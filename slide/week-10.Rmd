# Introduction

---

> “The Pope endorses Donald Trump” — a Facebook hoax that went viral in 2016

.center[<img src = 'https://web.colby.edu/cogblog/files/2019/12/ctm-clean-7am-cr470c-20161117-frame-79036-768x804.jpg' width = '30%'>]

- Appeared absurd, yet became influential
- A symbol of the rising global concern around false information online

---

## Threats to Democracy
- **Misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda (MDP)** now seen as fundamental threats
- Events such as QAnon, Covid-19 misinformation, and Jan 6 US Capitol riot in 2021 highlight dangers
- Obama (in 2018): Algorithms feed bias, create bubbles, fuel polarisation

## Democratic Backsliding
> “Erosion of the institutions and norms of democracy” (Levitsky & Ziblatt, 2018)

- Media and MDP play roles in undermining elections, trust, and accountability

# Definitions and Delineations

---

## Key Terms

- **Misinformation**: False information, not intended to deceive
- **Disinformation**: False information, intended to deceive
- **Malinformation**: True but used harmfully or stripped of context
- **Propaganda**: Long-term, manipulative campaigns

.content-box-yellow[

- **Misinformation**: *Sharing a rumour that Covid-19 vaccines contain microchips — without realising it's false*
- **Disinformation**: *Deliberately posting fake statistics about election fraud to undermine trust in the vote*
- **Malinformation**: *Leaking private text messages out of context to damage a public figure's reputation*
- **Propaganda**: *State-run media repeatedly portraying a minority group as a threat to national security over time*
]

---

## Types of Polarisation

.pull-left[
**Ideological Polarisation**
- Differences in policy positions, e.g., on climate change, healthcare, or immigration  
- Often measurable through surveys or party manifestos  
- .content-box-yellow[Example: Disagreement between parties on whether to increase taxes for public services]

**Affective Polarisation**  
- Emotional hostility between political or social groups  

]

.pull-right[

- People dislike members of the opposing party more than they disagree with their policies  
- .content-box-yellow[Example: Feeling anger or disgust toward supporters of an opposing party]

**Social Polarisation**  
- Perceived or real distance between identity-based groups  
- Rooted in race, religion, class, gender, or geography  
- .content-box-yellow[Example: Rural vs urban populations feeling increasingly disconnected in lifestyle and values]

# Platforms, Information, and Political Identity

---

## Political Identity Formation
- Identities are socially constructed: race, class, gender, nationality, etc.
- Media play a central role in shaping and reinforcing political identities

## Polarisation and Identity
- Sorting: Partisanship as “mega-identity” (Mason, 2016)
- Increasing alignment of political views with race, religion, geography, class

## The Role of Media
- Media help to construct “stories of peoplehood” (Smith, 2003)
- Platforms facilitate the formation of political identities and polarisation

---

## Is Polarisation Always Bad?
- Sometimes reflects real inequality, not just “division”
- Conflict may be necessary to address systemic injustice

.content-box-purple[
### Not all polarisation is harmful
  - Black Lives Matter (BLM) created a counterpublic that challenged dominant narratives about policing and racial justice  
  - Mobilised people around shared experiences of marginalisation  
  - Polarised public debate — but in ways that exposed systemic racism and demanded accountability

]

---

## Technology’s Role
- Easy to blame digital media, but structural and identity-based factors matter more
- Elites shape identities and conflict via media narratives

.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/thumb/c/c9/Discesa_Berlusconi.png/960px-Discesa_Berlusconi.png' width = '45%'>]

.footnote[Silvio Berlusconi’s “discesa in campo” — his entry into politics — was announced on 26 January 1994 via a 9-minute pre-recorded TV message aired on all national news programs.]

---

> "Our left-wing parties claim to have changed. .**They** say they’ve become liberal-democratic. But it’s not true. **Their** people are still the same, their mentality, their culture, their deepest convictions, their behaviours have remained the same. **They** don’t believe in the market, they don’t believe in private initiative, they don’t believe in profit, **they** don’t believe in the individual. **They** don’t believe the world can be improved through the free contribution of many people, each different from the other. **They** haven’t changed. Listen to them speak, watch **their** state-funded news programs, read **their** press. **They** no longer believe in anything. **They** want to turn the country into a shouting square — screaming, accusing, condemning." [...]

> "**We** want to renew Italian society. **We** want to support and instil confidence in those who create jobs and prosperity. **We** want to embrace and win the great productive and technological challenges of Europe and the modern world. **We** want to make space for anyone who wants to act and build their own future — in the North as well as the South. **We** want a government and a parliamentary majority that can give due dignity to the fundamental unit of every society — the family — that can respect every faith, and that can inspire reasonable hope in those who are vulnerable: those seeking work, those in need of care, those who, after a life of hard work, have the right to live in peace."

# Mis- and Disinformation and Propaganda (MDP)

---

## What is Mis- and Disinformation and Propaganda (MDP)?

- Like a river that flows through existing cultural and social channels
- Repurposes truth, half-truths, and symbols
- Works through existing prejudices and power structures

## MDP Dynamics

- Not new — existed since mass media era
- Now .content-box-green[amplified by platforms and algorithms]
- Can distort public opinion and undermine democratic accountability

---

## Network and Computational Propaganda

### Network Propaganda
Coordinated messaging spread across **multiple decentralised sources**, often appearing organic  
  - Increases credibility by repetition across seemingly unrelated accounts or outlets  
  - Example: Anti-vaccine content echoed across blogs, fringe media, and social media influencers

### Computational Propaganda 
Use of **algorithms, automation, and bots** to shape public opinion  
  - Bots amplify divisive content and manipulate trending topics  
  - Example: Russian bots active during the 2016 US election; social bots in Brazil promoting Bolsonaro

- These tactics make propaganda appear grassroots and authentic — harder to detect and resist



---

## Deepfakes and Automation

- AI-generated videos and manipulated content pose new threats
- “Dark participation”: trolling, mass-reporting, hashtag hijacking

# How Mis- and Disinformation and Propaganda (MDP) Works

---

## MDP and Power

.content-box-yellow[
**MDP is a tool of political elites and systems of power**
]

### Strategic Use by Elites
Political actors use MDP to shape narratives, legitimise actions, and undermine opponents  
- Example: Brazilian President Bolsonaro spread Covid-19 disinformation to downplay the crisis and avoid restrictions  
- Example: Indian government promoted herbal remedies while dismissing scientific evidence

### Targets Marginalised Groups
MDP often blames or dehumanises minorities, reinforcing social hierarchies  
- Example: Anti-Rohingya content on Facebook enabled by Myanmar’s military to justify ethnic cleansing  
- Example: Misinformation about immigrants spread to justify harsh border policies

---

### Reinforces Structural Inequality
MDP circulates within existing narratives of power and exclusion  
- Amplifies messages aligned with dominant ideologies (e.g., nationalism, patriarchy) 
- Suppresses counter-narratives by discrediting activists, journalists, or opposition leaders

> As Oreskes & Conway (2010) argue: ignorance is not passive — it is *produced* for political or commercial purposes

### Creates Doubt to Prevent Action
Doubt becomes a strategy to block regulation, accountability, or reform  
- E.g. climate denialism campaigns funded by fossil fuel interests  
- Covid-19 doubt sown to resist state intervention and protect elite economic interests
  
.footnote[Oreskes, N. & Conway, E. M. (2010) “Defeating the merchants of doubt,” *Nature* 465: 686–7.]

---

## Elite Cues and Public Opinion

### Elites shape beliefs and behaviour
Political science shows citizens often take “cues” from trusted elites, rather than forming opinions independently  
- Leaders signal what is credible, legitimate, and aligned with group identity  
- Example: Donald Trump’s repeated claims of election fraud fuelled widespread belief in a “stolen election” among Republican voters

### MDP is more effective when endorsed by elites
- Elites lend legitimacy to false or misleading claims  
- Helps MDP bypass scepticism and spread through identity-driven trust

---

### People engage with MDP to signal identity
Sharing MDP can be a form of group belonging, not just belief in truth  
- Users may post misinformation to show loyalty, opposition, or cultural alignment  
- Even satire or memes can carry political allegiance

.content-box-green[

When people say they believe something, they may be expressing who they are — not what they know. (Marwick & Hargittai, 2019)

]

.footnote[Marwick, A. & Hargittai, E. (2019) “Nothing to hide, nothing to lose? Incentives and disincentives to sharing information with institutions online,” *Information, Communication & Society* 22(12): 1697–1713.]

---

## Superusers, Networks, and Hybrid Media

### MDP is often highly concentrated 
A small number of “superusers” or coordinated accounts generate most viral content  

### Network effects amplify influence
- Users with large followings or institutional power shape what others see  
- Strategic actors exploit algorithms by creating engagement through outrage, controversy, or repetition

---

### Hybrid media systems

MDP flows between fringe platforms, mainstream media, and social media  
- A conspiracy theory might start on Telegram, go viral on Twitter, then be reported on by traditional outlets  
- Example: "Freedom Convoy" protests in Canada — boosted by fringe groups, bots, Fox News, and political influencers

“Trading up the chain” (Krafft & Donovan, 2020): manipulators move fringe content to higher-visibility outlets

# Public Knowledge, Information, and Democracy

---

## Enlightenment Ideals
- Rational debate, informed public central to democratic legitimacy .content-box-yellow[➡️ Habermas' **public sphere**]
- Institutions: journalism, academia, government statistics



### Declining public trust in journalism, science, and government  
- Fueled by elite attacks (e.g. “fake news”, “enemy of the people”)  
- Rise of hyperpartisan and ideological media environments  
- Perception that institutions are politically biased or out of touch

### Platforms disrupt traditional authority 
- Anyone can publish and share information at scale  
- Undermines editorial gatekeeping — but also allows new voices to emerge  
- Example: Black, queer, or trans creators gaining audiences denied by legacy media


---

## Inequality and the Politics of Trust


### Trust is not neutral or universal  
Historically, many communities were excluded or misrepresented by institutions now calling for trust  
- Journalism has privileged dominant groups and ignored or distorted others  
- Scientific and medical fields have long histories of racial and gendered harm

### Platforms and journalism reproduce power dynamics 
- Who gets fact-checked? Who gets de-platformed?  
- Whose knowledge is considered legitimate?

### Structural inequality shapes information access and credibility
- Marginalised groups may distrust institutions for good reason  
- Trust must be earned — not demanded

---

## Who Gets to Decide What Is True?

.pull-left[

### Platforms make editorial choices 
- Algorithms prioritise certain content  
- Moderation policies define what’s acceptable  
- These are political decisions with real-world effects

### Contested authority over truth 
- Should platforms or governments decide what is misinformation?  
- What about when truth is still evolving (e.g. early Covid-19 science)?

]

.pull-right[

### Information governance is about power
Deciding what is “harmful” or “false” involves value judgments  
- Whose voices are amplified or silenced?  
- Who benefits from defining reality?

.content-box-yellow[

The battle over misinformation is also a battle over who gets to define reality in democratic societies

## Kuo & Marwick (2021): Critical Disinformation Studies

- Disinformation is not just about *falsehood* — it’s about *power*, *history*, and *identity*
- Disinformation often reinforces **white supremacy**, **colonial narratives**, and **economic hierarchies**  
- Legacy media has long *misinformed* through selective coverage (e.g., "welfare queens", racialised crime)  
- Platform focus **depoliticises** disinfo — treating it like “pollution” instead of a product of **structural inequality**

### Instead of measuring exposure, we must ask:  
- Whose truths are dismissed?  
- Whose voices are amplified or silenced?

.content-box-yellow[A critical lens shifts the focus from individual *belief accuracy* to collective *systems of power and harm*]

---

## But Can There Be a Science of Misinformation?

- Dan Williams’ critique (2024): Misleadingness is subjective, value-laden, and unquantifiable"

### Main Argument:  
- Clear-cut misinformation is rare  
- Broader forms (e.g. framing, omission) are too context-sensitive to study scientifically  
- Overfocus on misinformation risks becoming a *moral panic*  
- True-but-misleading content is *common* — but too amorphous for scientific treatment

- **Implication**:  Efforts to classify and quantify "misleadingness" risk entrenching bias and silencing legitimate dissent

- **Critical Question**:  Who decides what is misleading — and under what authority?

.footnote[Williams, D. (2024, July 28). Misinformation researchers are wrong: There can’t be a science of misleading content. https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/misinformation-researchers-are-wrong]
