# Introduction

---

> “The Pope endorses Donald Trump” — a Facebook hoax that went viral in 2016

.center[<img src = 'https://web.colby.edu/cogblog/files/2019/12/ctm-clean-7am-cr470c-20161117-frame-79036-768x804.jpg' width = '30%'>]

- Appeared absurd, yet became influential
- A symbol of the rising global concern around false information online

---

## Threats to Democracy
- **Misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda (MDP)** now seen as fundamental threats
- Events such as QAnon, Covid-19 misinformation, and Jan 6 US Capitol riot in 2021 highlight dangers
- Obama (in 2018): Algorithms feed bias, create bubbles, fuel polarisation

## Democratic Backsliding
> “Erosion of the institutions and norms of democracy” (Levitsky & Ziblatt, 2018)

- Media and MDP play roles in undermining elections, trust, and accountability

# Definitions and Delineations

---

## Key Terms

- **Misinformation**: False information, not intended to deceive
- **Disinformation**: False information, intended to deceive
- **Malinformation**: True but used harmfully or stripped of context
- **Propaganda**: Long-term, manipulative campaigns

---



---

## Polarisation Types
- **Ideological**: Differences in policy views
- **Affective**: Hostility between groups
- **Social**: Perceived group distance

## Historical Context
- Propaganda has long been used for racial, political, and wartime purposes
- MDP not new — only amplified by digital platforms

---

# 10.3 Platforms, Information, and Political Identity

## Political Identity Formation
- Identities are socially constructed: race, class, gender, nationality, etc.
- Media play a central role in shaping and reinforcing political identities

## Polarisation and Identity
- Sorting: Partisanship as “mega-identity” (Mason, 2016)
- Increasing alignment of political views with race, religion, geography, class

## The Role of Media
- Media help to construct “stories of peoplehood” (Smith, 2003)
- Platforms facilitate the formation of political identities and polarisation

---

## Is Polarisation Always Bad?
- Sometimes reflects real inequality, not just “division”
- Conflict may be necessary to address systemic injustice

## Technology’s Role
- Easy to blame digital media, but structural and identity-based factors matter more
- Elites shape identities and conflict via media narratives

# 10.4 Mis- and Disinformation and Propaganda (MDP)

## What is MDP?
> “Like a river” — flows through existing cultural and social channels

- Repurposes truth, half-truths, and symbols
- Works through existing prejudices and power structures

## MDP Dynamics
- Not new — existed since mass media era
- Now amplified by platforms and algorithms
- Can distort public opinion and undermine democratic accountability

---

## Network and Computational Propaganda
- **Network Propaganda**: Multiple, decentralised sources reinforce messages
- **Computational Propaganda**: Social bots, automation, and manipulation

## Impact on Democracy
- Skews public understanding
- Targets minority candidates and vulnerable groups
- Can silence dissent, distort opinion climates

---

## Deepfakes and Automation
- AI-generated videos and manipulated content pose new threats
- “Dark participation”: trolling, mass-reporting, hashtag hijacking

# 10.5 How MDP Works

## MDP and Power
> “MPD is a tool of political elites and systems of power”

- Targets marginalised groups or amplifies dominant ones
- Often reflects pre-existing inequality and systemic conflict

## Examples
- Facebook's role in anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar
- Covid-19 misinformation driven by right-wing political goals
- “Freedom Convoy” in Canada boosted by international and online disinformation networks

---

## Elite Cues and Public Opinion
- Elites shape public beliefs; MDP gains power when echoed by leaders
- People engage with MDP to express identity and affiliation

## Superusers and Networks
- MDP is often spread by a small number of coordinated or influential actors
- Hybrid media systems amplify messages across online and offline spaces

# 10.6 Public Knowledge, Information, and Democracy

## Enlightenment Ideals
- Rational debate, informed public central to democratic legitimacy
- Institutions: journalism, academia, government statistics

## Crises of Trust
- Declining trust in knowledge-producing institutions
- Platforms challenge legacy institutions; also empower marginalised voices

## Inequality and Information
- “Trust” is not universal — histories of exclusion, colonialism, and racism matter
- Platforms and journalism often reproduce existing power dynamics

---

## Who Gets to Decide?
- Who determines what is “truthful” or “harmful”?
- What information should platforms elevate or suppress?

---

# 10.7 What Should Be Our Response to MDP

## Individual Action
- Be critical of content
- Avoid sharing unverified information
- Support fact-based institutions and marginalised voices

## Collective and Institutional Action
- Platforms must develop:
  - Clear, democracy-worthy policies
  - Strong moderation, especially of elite actors
  - Transparency and accountability mechanisms

## Role of Journalism
- Journalism should:
  - Fact-check
  - Hold elites and platforms accountable
  - Balance representation with commitment to truth

---

## Challenges
- Some “disinformation” claims are themselves weaponised
- Correcting MDP does not resolve deeper political conflict

> Focus should be on *resilience*, not just takedowns

---

# 10.8 Summary

## Key Takeaways
- MDP is deeply embedded in power and identity
- Polarisation is not always a threat — inequality often is
- Journalism, platforms, and publics all play a role in responding
- Trust, truth, and regulation are deeply political

## Final Reflection
> We are only beginning to understand how political communication and identity are shaped in the digital age

# Discussion Questions

- How would you write a clickbait headline to lure readers into this chapter?
- What dangers do deepfakes pose to democracy? Can they be mitigated?
- Should platforms have the power to decide what is “true”? Why or why not?
