## **Introduction**

> Politics deals with relations, power, identity, and decision-making.

- Political communication is more than just elections and policymaking—it shapes and reflects power, identity, and public life.

> [Political] communication creates what people understand to be political.

- Communication is symbolic and takes many forms: speech, text, images, video, and digital media.

- Platforms have changed political communication, but historical, social, and institutional factors still shape how it functions.

---

## **Defining Political Communication**

- Political communication is "communication about politics"—but what counts as political is constantly evolving.
- It includes messages about power, governance, identity, and public issues.
- Political communication can turn private matters into public debates (e.g., domestic violence, LGBTQIA+ rights, or racial justice movements).

---

## **Key Actors in Political Communication**
- Political communication is produced by a variety of actors:
  - **Political elites** (elected officials, parties, candidates) and **political entrepreneurs**
  - **Journalists** and media organizations
  - **Advocacy groups** and **movements**
  - **Citizens**, influencers, and everyday social media users
  - **Algorithms**, bots, and **platforms** themselves

.content-box-red[

**Platforms** shape political discourse through 

1. **instrumentarian power** (Zuboff, 2018), 
2. **curation power** (Gillespie, 2018), and 
3. **system administration power** (Bratton, 2016).

## Platform's communication powers


| **Forms of Power**            | **Definition**                                                                 | **Example in Political Communication**                                    |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Instrumentarian Power** (Zuboff, 2018) | The ability of platforms to observe, interpret, and modify user behavior through data collection and predictive analytics. | Social media platforms use vast data analytics to target political ads, influence voter behavior, and shape political discourse through algorithmic predictions. |
| **Curation Power** (Gillespie, 2018) | The ability to filter, rank, and prioritize content through platform algorithms and moderation policies, thereby structuring what users see and engage with. | Platforms promote certain political messages or suppress others by adjusting newsfeed algorithms, shadow banning, or fact-checking content. |
| **System Administration Power** (Bratton, 2016) | The sovereign control platforms have over their infrastructure, including the ability to permit or deny access, regulate terms of service, and shape the technical standards for participation. | Twitter banning a political leader, Facebook altering API access for political campaign data, or governments negotiating content takedown policies with platforms. |

## **How Political Communication Varies Across Contexts**
- **Media systems**: Some countries have strong public broadcasters (BBC, ABC), while others rely heavily on commercial media.
- **Political structures**: Presidential vs. parliamentary systems shape how communication flows.
- **Regulation & press freedom**: Some states allow free press, while others censor and control media.
- **Cultural & historical influences**: Different societies prioritize different political issues and communication styles.

### What is an audience?

A group of people who are immersed in a common experience through the same medium. 

- A traditional understanding of audience: large, homogenous collection of passive recipients of a message.

- A more recent understanding of audience: active, co-creating and reshaping meaning.

---

## **Mass Media vs. Digital Platforms**
- **Mass media era**: Gatekeeping by journalists, structured formats, limited public participation.
- **Platform era**: Algorithmic curation, user-generated content, audience fragmentation.
- **Continuities**: Political actors still rely on media strategies, and traditional media still shape public discourse.

---

## **Case Studies: Comparing Political Communication**
- **United States**: Presidential system, strong commercial media, highly polarized social media debates.
- **Switzerland**: Consensus-driven politics, coalition governments, and lower emphasis on media-driven electioneering.
- **China**: State-controlled media, censorship, but also sophisticated online activism using coded language.

---

- **Study by Lu & Pan (2021)** explores how the Chinese government uses clickbait strategies to increase propaganda visibility on **WeChat Official Accounts**.
- **Clickbait Techniques**: Sensational headlines, hyperbolic words, ellipsis, question marks, and listicles.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Clickbait is used **as frequently as in commercial and celebrity accounts**.
  - Clickbait **boosts engagement and ranking** without using disinformation.
  - The strategy adapts **authoritarian propaganda to digital competition for attention**.
- **Implications**:
  - Demonstrates how **governments use platform affordances for political communication**.
  - Highlights how **quantification pressures shape propaganda strategies**.
  - Expands understanding of **digital authoritarianism beyond censorship and disinformation**.

## Media and the Public Sphere in Political Communication

- The **public sphere** (Habermas, 1962) is where citizens engage in political discourse and shape public opinion.
- Niklas Luhmann (2000) emphasized that our knowledge of society is mediated—citizens rarely experience politics directly.
- Historically, mass media structured the public sphere, determining what issues gained visibility and legitimacy.

**Key Insights:**
- Traditional media (newspapers, radio, TV) acted as **gatekeepers** to the public sphere.
- Digital platforms have altered access, expanding participation but also fragmenting discourse.
- The public sphere is now shaped by competing forces: journalism, platforms, and algorithmic curation.

## From Mass Media to Platformized Public Spheres

- The transition from centralized mass media to **networked public spheres** (Benkler, 2006) has restructured political communication.
- While mass media once provided a **shared informational space**, platforms now create **many fragmented and algorithmically driven spheres**.
- This shift has both **democratized political participation** and intensified **echo chambers and polarization**.

**Key Transformations:**
- Legacy media operated through **editorial curation**; platforms rely on **algorithmic amplification**.
- The public sphere is now shaped by **attention economies**, where engagement-driven content dominates.
- Political actors and movements **navigate multiple publics**, strategically using platforms for mobilization.

---

## The Public Sphere, Platforms, and Political Power

- Platforms mediate the **new public sphere**, influencing political discourse through algorithmic visibility.
- Political actors now **perform for engagement**, aligning with **platform logics** rather than deliberative democracy.
- The fragmentation of the public sphere raises concerns about **misinformation, political polarization, and declining trust in institutions**.

**Key Debates:**
- Do platforms enhance deliberation, or do they erode the **quality of public discourse**?
- How does the shift from **journalistic gatekeeping to algorithmic curation** affect democratic participation?
- What regulatory or governance mechanisms could sustain a **healthy public sphere** in the digital age?

.pull-right[

- **Platforms + Media at the Core**: Platforms shape political discourse by structuring content, technology, and governance.
- **Platforms Are Not Neutral**: Algorithms, policies, and affordances influence what political content is visible and how it circulates.
- **Political Communication as a System**: Political discourse occurs within media ecosystems influenced by power structures, regulations, and institutions.

]

.pull-right[

- **Power Flows in Both Directions**: Media and platforms are shaped by history, society, culture, and economy—and they also shape these forces.
- **Different Political & Media Systems**: Regulation, press freedom, and economic contexts define how platforms operate globally.
- **Example - Germany**: Strict platform governance and hate speech laws shaped by historical experiences (e.g., bans on Holocaust denial).
- **Key Takeaway**: Political communication is embedded in broader social systems—platforms mediate but do not determine its outcomes.
