# Introduction

---

## What Counts as Political Communication?

&gt; “Political communication concerns all manner of things that relate to what we share and how we live with others.”

- Political communication is not limited to parties or policies  
- It is embedded in popular culture: music, sport, fashion, memes  
- Politics can be “sung,” “performed,” or “streamed”

---

## Examples of Everyday Political Expression

.pull-left[
- Athletes kneeling for racial justice  
- Comedians parodying governments  
- Memes mocking leaders or celebrating resistance  
- TikTok dance trends that incorporate protest slogans  
- Clothes worn by politicians and celebrities

# The History of Politainment and Infotainment

---


## From Elitism to Cultural Politics

&gt; “For most of the twentieth century, scholars... made a distinction between high culture and low culture... serious news and low-quality information.”

- Early critics like Neil Postman decried entertainment’s rise  
- Cultural studies (e.g. Stuart Hall) reclaimed popular culture as political  
- Resistance and identity emerge from subcultures and style

---

## The Personal Is Political

.pull-left[

- Feminists showed how everyday life is structured by power  
- Rap and hip hop exposed systemic injustice and mobilised action  
- Pop culture isn't just escapism – it can be a battlefield of ideas

&gt; “Some politicians become celebrities and icons of pop culture.”

- Example: Obamas, Kennedys, Greta Thunberg  
- They influence not only politics, but fashion, language, lifestyles

## When Celebrities -&gt; Become -&gt; Politicians

.pull-left[


&gt; “Trump, Reagan, Schwarzenegger, Zelensky... transformed from entertainer to elected official.”

- Fame becomes political capital  
- Digital charisma replaces institutional credibility

## Political Celebrity Typologies

### Superstar Politicians

- Rely on **broadcast media** and **staged charisma**
- Project strength, control, and exceptionality
- Examples: Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama, Volodymyr Zelensky (as TV figure), Queen Elizabeth II
- Often work through curated media appearances, professional PR teams, and high-production value events

&gt; “Superstar celebrity politicians rely more on broadcast media and have consciously staged marketing techniques and perform an exceptional role.” (see Wood et al., 2016)

.footnote[Wood, M. Corbett, J., &amp; Flinders, M. (2016) “Just like us: everyday celebrity politicians and the pursuit of popularity in an age of anti-politics,” *The British Journal of Politics and International Relations* 18(3): 581–98.]

---

### Everyday Political Celebrities

.pull-left[

- Emerge via **digital platforms** using informal, intimate content
- Perform authenticity, spontaneity, and relatability
- Examples: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Instagram Lives, Macron’s hoodie photos, Boris Johnson’s “dishevelled” persona
- More likely to show flaws and ‘behind-the-scenes’ moments, aligning with audience affect

&gt; They "perform authentic roles as flawed, regular folks" (see Wood et al., 2016)

---

### Tensions and Trade-offs

- **Democratic engagement**: Reach disengaged citizens, especially young people; bypass elite filters; energise participation  
- **Post-democratic spectacle**: Risk of style over substance; populism; erosion of deliberation and accountability  

&gt; "Spectacularization" of politics, of the "dumbing down" of culture ... "The rise of celebrity politicians is just another symptom of the hollowing out of democracy... but may also mark a democratisation process.” (see Street, 2012)

.footnote[Street, J. (2012) “Do celebrity politics and celebrity politicians matter?” The *British Journal of Politics and International Relations* 14(3): 346–56.]

# Media Monarchies and the Internet

---

## Monarchs as Media Figures

### Monarchs as Political Symbols

- Monarchs are not just ceremonial: they **stabilise national identity** and embody continuity  
- Even when stripped of formal power, they participate in **political communication** through ritual, tradition, and symbolism  
- Example: Queen Elizabeth II’s long reign offered symbolic consistency through periods of crisis (e.g., Brexit, COVID-19)

&gt; “Monarchs are politicians – in obvious ways, when they hold political power, but also in more subtle ways when they do not and speak only through symbols.”

---

### The Politics of Presentation

- Royal families are **carefully curated media brands**  
- Strategic use of **visuals** to project meaning and legitimacy:
  - Instagram portraits
  - Subtle political messaging through jewellery and fashion (e.g., EU hat during Brexit speech)
  - Family imagery as dynastic continuity (e.g., 4-generation Windsor photo)

&gt; “The image carries a dynastic claim... spanning roughly 150 years of past and future rule.”  

.center[&lt;img src = 'https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/944d93868496ec353f31e527a92617abe93f84f6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1900&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none' width = '30%'&gt;]


---

### Media Monarchies in the Platform Age

.pull-left[

- Royals operate as **celebrity influencers with political weight**
  - Official social media accounts with millions of followers  
  - Mix of tradition and digital savviness
- Perform **spectacle and governance** through platforms:
  - Instagram, YouTube, Facebook
  - Tweets, live streams, curated photo ops

# Political Influencers

---

## Rise of the Political Influencer

&gt; “Influencers are digital opinion leaders... with **leadership** based in **authenticity**.” (see Riedl et al. 2021)

### Who Are Political Influencers?

- Individuals with significant social media followings  
- Operate **outside formal institutions** (not politicians, journalists, or NGOs)  
- Blend lifestyle, identity, and ideology—often starting from non-political content  
- Range from YouTubers and podcasters to TikTok creators and micro-influencers

.footnote[Riedl, M., Schwemmer, C., Ziewiecki, S., &amp; Ross, L. M. (2021) “The rise of political influencers: perspectives on a trend towards meaningful content,” *Frontiers in Communication* 6: 1–7.]
---

### Strategic Authenticity

.pull-left[

- **Perceived relatability** is their key asset  
- Success depends on appearing **real**, **unfiltered**, and **vulnerable**  
- This authenticity is often **staged and strategic** (e.g., “behind-the-scenes” content, family vlogs, Q&amp;A videos)

&gt; “Networked intimacy and strategic authenticity are now being mobilized in support for metapolitical goals.” (Maly, 2020)

]

.footnote[Maly, I. (2020) “Metapolitical new right influencers: the case of Brittany Pettibone,” *Social Sciences* 9(7): 113.]

---

### Political Campaigns and Influencer Marketing

- Influencers are hired by parties or advocacy groups to:
  - Promote campaigns to niche or hard-to-reach audiences
  - Circulate political messages in relatable formats (e.g., feminist make-up tutorials)
  - Encourage voting, activism, or ideological alignment

- Example: Use of TikTokers and Instagrammers to engage Gen Z during elections

.center[&lt;img src = 'https://images.theconversation.com/files/415672/original/file-20210811-23-7e0crk.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip' width = '55%'&gt;]

.footnote[Zeng, J. &amp; Abidin, C. (2021) “‘# OkBoomer, time to meet the Zoomers’: studying the memefication of intergenerational politics on TikTok,” *Information, Communication &amp; Society* 24(16): 2459–81.]

---

## #OkBoomer: A Memetic Youth Movement (Zeng &amp; Abidin, 2021)

- TikTok served as a key site for Gen Z’s political identity and generational critique  
- The #OkBoomer meme became a form of **discursive activism** and everyday politics, mixing humour, music, and skits to express discontent with older generations  
- Topics included climate change, gender norms, mental health, and economic insecurity

&gt; “Being a Boomer is not an age-specific phenomenon but rather a mindset.” – Zeng &amp; Abidin (2021)

.footnote[Zeng, J. &amp; Abidin, C. (2021) “‘# OkBoomer, time to meet the Zoomers’: studying the memefication of intergenerational politics on TikTok,” *Information, Communication &amp; Society* 24(16): 2459–81.]

---

## Memes as Political Communication (Zeng &amp; Abidin, 2021)

- Gen Z used TikTok memes to **construct generational borders** and express shared grievances  
- Memes combined sound templates, duets, visual stickers, and performance (e.g., lip-sync activism)  

- Three major communicative functions:  
  - **Critique**: calling out patronising or conservative attitudes  
  - **Community**: sharing experiences and solidarity  
  - **Commerce**: turning memes into merchandise, risking dilution of meaning

- Memes function as “small-p” politics, framing identity and injustice through everyday cultural participation

.footnote[Zeng, J. &amp; Abidin, C. (2021) “‘# OkBoomer, time to meet the Zoomers’: studying the memefication of intergenerational politics on TikTok,” *Information, Communication &amp; Society* 24(16): 2459–81.]

---

### Tensions and Risks

- Often **not transparent** about paid affiliations: “volunteer digital door knockers” or covert campaigners?  
- Risk of **manipulation**, **misinformation**, and **unregulated political advertising**  
- Blurs lines between personal opinion, monetisation, and propaganda

.content-box-yellow[

.center[&lt;img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Logo_Tenet_Media.svg' width = '30%'&gt;]

- **Tenet Media**, a U.S. right-wing media startup, was secretly funded with $10 million by Russian state actors to spread propaganda through popular conservative influencers.

- The founders allegedly **masked Russian ties** using a fictitious European sponsor; influencers were paid large sums to produce political content aligned with Kremlin interests.

- The scheme was exposed by the U.S. DOJ in 2024, leading to **indictments, YouTube bans, and Tenet’s shutdown**, as influencers claimed to be unwitting participants.

]

---

## Political Campaigning Meets Platform Culture

- Targeted content via influencers = new propaganda?  
- Micro-influencers often unpaid or undisclosed surrogates  
- Lifestyle content can carry ideological messages

.pull-left[

### Influencer Case Examples

- AOC’s Vogue make-up video: 3.6M+ views  
- Far-right influencer Brittany Pettibone blends family with conspiracy  
- Feminist make-up tutorials and queer TikTok activism

# Music and Political Communication

---

## Songs as Tools of Resistance and Identity

&gt; “Music sustains oppositional identities that have deep political implications.”

- Protest anthems across history: La Marseillaise, reggae, anti-apartheid  
- Soundtracks of movements: Black Lives Matter and Kendrick Lamar

.pull-left[

- **Kendrick Lamar**’s 2025 Super Bowl show used powerful symbolism to confront racism, white supremacy, and America’s treatment of Black Americans.  
- Samuel L. Jackson portrayed a critical “Uncle Sam” figure, and the performance referenced reparations and resistance.

---

## Music in the Hands of Politicians

- Politicians use music for branding: playlists, walk-on songs  
- Artists sometimes push back: e.g., Springsteen vs Reagan  
- Music communicates belonging, identity, resistance

# Movies, Shows, and Political Communication

---

## Fiction as Political Reality

&gt; “Visual communication is powerful... the ways we perceive the world are influenced by media representations.”

- Shows like *The West Wing*, *Borgen*, *Game of Thrones* shape political imagination  
- Political satire increases participation and knowledge

.center[&lt;img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/Twenty_Five_%28The_West_Wing_episode_-_screenshot%29.jpg'&gt;]

---

## Entertainment as Political Pedagogy

### Shows as Analogies for Real Politics

- Politicians and movements often use popular shows to **frame political narratives** and connect with audiences.  

.pull-left[

- Example: Spain’s left-populist party **Podemos** referenced *Game of Thrones* in speeches and media—likening their struggle to Daenerys Targaryen’s fight against elites.  
- Party leader Pablo Iglesias even edited a book of political essays analysing *GoT*—using fiction to **mobilise younger voters** and communicate complex ideas in accessible ways.

]



---

### From Apolitical to Political Talk

- Even content not explicitly political can **spark political discussion**: reality TV, romance dramas, and true crime shows raise issues around gender, justice, inequality, and identity.  
- Casual conversations about shows often evolve into **informal political dialogue**, which research shows is critical for civic awareness.  

&gt; "It matters for political knowledge how much people talk about politics, even more than with whom they talk." (see Amsalem &amp; Nir 2021)

.footnote[Amsalem, E. &amp; Nir, L. (2021) “Does interpersonal discussion increase political knowledge? A meta-analysis,” *Communication Research* 48(5): 619–41.]

---

### Streaming Platforms as Political Spaces

- Platforms like **Spotify**, **YouTube, Netflix, TikTok, and Twitch** are key sites of political meaning-making and debate.  
- Influencers, streamers, and content creators integrate activism, satire, and commentary into entertainment—blurring lines between information, opinion, and art.  
- This transforms passive viewing into **participatory political engagement**, especially for younger, digitally native audiences.
