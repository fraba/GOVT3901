## Introduction

- Platforms operate **within legal**, political, and economic contexts
- Example: "Right to be forgotten" case in the EU

.content-box-yellow[

**What Happened?** In 2014, a Spanish man won a major case at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)
- He wanted Google to remove an old news article about his house being sold to repay debts

**What Did the Court Say?** Search engines like Google are responsible for the links they show
- People can ask for old, irrelevant, or harmful personal information to be removed
- Platforms must balance: A **person's right to privacy** and the **public's right to know**

]

- **Governance involves balancing** individual privacy vs public right to know

# Governance as a Concept

---

## What is Governance?

> "Governance extends the scope of regulation and rule-making beyond state actors."

1. Broader than state **regulation**
2. Includes transnational bodies, treaties, international organisations
3. Include non-state, profit and non-profit actors
4. Establishes rules **and** enforces compliance

.center[<img src = "https://betterimagesofai.org/ImagesAI/joining-the-table_yutong-liu_5197x2712.png?nf_resize=fit&w=1920&q=75" width = '45%'>]

## Governance vs Regulation vs Coordination

- **Coordination**: The broadest category, encompassing *all reciprocal interactions* that mediate mutual adjustments without necessarily aiming at collective rule-making.
- **Regulation**: *Goal-oriented*, intentional interventions (e.g., laws, policies) designed to influence behavior in specific domains.
- **Governance**: *Reflexive processes* that question and redefine the norms and conditions underpinning coordination, often without predefined objectives or outcomes.


.footnote[Hofmann, J., Katzenbach, C., & Gollatz, K. (2017). Between coordination and regulation: Finding the governance in Internet governance. *New Media & Society*, 19(9), 1406–1423. https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444816639975]

---

## Media Governance

> "Media governance sets the background conditions that media and platforms operate in."

- Structures and processes facilitating and constraining media behaviour
- Governs incentives, limitations, and actor behaviour

.content-box-yellow[

### Spotlighted Cases

- **Russia:** Pressures platforms to remove anti-government content
- **India:** Pursued censorship of anti-government material on Twitter
- **Belarus:** Banned live-streaming protests

# State Regulation and Self-Regulation

---

## State Regulation of Media

> "The more (and more complex) technologies are involved, the more the state engages in regulation."

- Television historically regulated due to limited broadcast spectrum
- Newspapers often self-regulated
- Regulation = ownership, licensing, content standards

.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Silvertone_7270_television_set_powering_up_at_the_Early_Television_Museum_June_2022.jpg' width = '15%'>]

- Paradoxically, state regulation can also protect media freedom: "non-regulation by the state can be an instrument for exercising power and repression"

---

## Media Self-Regulation

> "Self-regulation is designed to stave off the threat of state intervention."

- Codes of ethics for journalists
- Professional associations enforce rules
- Example: UK's Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO)

.content-box-green[

### Spotlighted Cases

- **UK phone-hacking scandal:** Led to collapse of *News of the World* and showed how self-regulation doesn't always work.

- **Community radio in Mexico and Argentina:** Struggled for decades for legal recognition

# National and Transnational Governance


---

## Global vs National Governance

- **Global:** UN's Article 19 on freedom of expression (non-binding)
- **National:** Wide variation in enforcement and values
- Regulatory gaps allow platforms to "forum shop" for favourable jurisdictions.

.content-box-yellow[

### Example: Platform Migration

- Google and Facebook headquartered in Ireland for lax EU privacy enforcement
- Telegram moved to Dubai to escape Russian regulation

# Governance Issues: Media Pluralism


---

## What is Media Pluralism?

> "Plurality... is often seen as the cornerstone of democracy."

- **Internal pluralism**: diversity *within* an outlet
  - Example: A newspaper showing multiple political views, not just one side
- **External pluralism**: diversity *across* outlets and ownership
  - Example: Having newspapers, TV stations, websites owned by different companies with different views

.content-box-red[

### Threats to Pluralism

- Media concentration (e.g., Rupert Murdoch’s holdings)
- Digital platforms now replicate traditional media concentration

]

---

## High-Choice Media Environments

> "Information abundance does not necessarily result in more diverse information; media consumers might just get more of the same from fewer sources (the diversity paradox) (van Aelst et al. (2017))"

### What Does This Mean?

- We now have **more information than ever** — news, blogs, podcasts, social media
- In theory, more choices should mean a **wider range of opinions and sources** but in practice, many people end up consuming information from **only a few dominant sources**


.footnote[Van Aelst, P., ... (2017). Political communication in a high-choice media environment: A challenge for democracy? Annals of the International Communication Association, 41(1), 3–27. https://doi.org/10.1080/23808985.2017.1288551]

---

### The "Diversity Paradox"

- Even with lots of content, **big media companies** and **platforms** still dominate
- Users may choose content that **confirms their existing views** (confirmation bias)
- Algorithms recommend **similar** content, reinforcing narrow worldviews


### Risks of High-Choice Environments

- **Information overload**: too much information can overwhelm users
- **Echo chambers**: people only hear views they already agree with
- **Loss of shared public debate**: citizens may no longer engage with common facts

# The History of Platform Governance


---

## Early Internet Governance

- 1990s: Internet seen as free, unregulatable
- John Perry Barlow's .content-box-green[**Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace**]

.pull-left[

- Governments should not regulate the Internet.
- Cyberspace is a new, independent world, separate from the "real world" of nations and laws.
- People online form their own communities and rules — without the need for government control.

]

.pull-right[

.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/WikipediaBarlow20060529.png' width = '45%'>]

> "A world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice... where anyone, anywhere may express their beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity."

]



---

## Code as Law

> "The design and code of technologies worked to define what the Internet is." (Lessig, 2000)


- **Lawrence Lessig** (2000) argued that **the architecture of the Internet** — how it is built — acts like a form of law
- **Code** (the software, design, and technical rules) controls what users can and cannot do
- Example: 
  - A platform’s design can **allow free speech** or **block certain behaviour**
  - Algorithms can **promote** or **hide** information


- **Section 230** of the US Communications Decency Act (1996):
  - Says platforms are **not legally responsible** for user content
  - Platforms are **"intermediaries"**, not publishers

.footnote[Lessig, L. (2000) “Code is law: on liberty in cyberspace,” Harvard Magazine 1.]

---

## Platforms as "Neutral Intermediaries"

- Platforms presented themselves as **neutral spaces**:
  - Just "connecting people," not curating or controlling content
  - Avoided traditional media regulations (such as defamation or broadcasting standards)

- This framing helped them:
  - **Grow quickly**
  - **Avoid legal liability**
  - **Delay government regulation** for many years

# Platform Self-Governance

---

## Platform Self-Regulation

> "Self-regulation is not static, but constantly changing."

- Platforms set and enforce community standards
- Example: Content moderation, banning Trump after January

.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol_DSC09254-2_%2850820534063%29_%28retouched%29.jpg/960px-2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol_DSC09254-2_%2850820534063%29_%28retouched%29.jpg' width = '55%'>]

---

## Problems with Self-Governance

- **Non-transparency**: Platforms set rules but are often unclear about how decisions are made or enforced.
- **Automation failures**: AI moderation struggles with complex content and non-English languages, missing hate speech or wrongly deleting posts.
- **Hyper-concentration of power**: A few private companies control global speech without democratic oversight.

.content-box-yellow[

Self-regulation often protects platform interests more than users, raising major concerns for democracy, free speech, and accountability.

]

---

## What is Algorithmic Content Moderation?

> "Automated hash-matching and predictive machine learning tools are increasingly being deployed to conduct content moderation at scale. "

- Platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have been using AI to manage user content
- Two main types of systems:
  - **Matching Systems**: detect exact or near-duplicate content (e.g., terrorist videos, copyrighted material)
  - **Predictive Systems**: classify new content based on features (e.g., hate speech, toxicity)

- High-profile case: **Christchurch attack video** reuploaded 1.5 million times, 80% blocked automatically.

.footnote[Gorwa, R., Binns, R., & Katzenbach, C. (2020). Algorithmic content moderation: Technical and political challenges in the automation of platform governance. *Big Data & Society*, 7(1), 2053951719897945. https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951719897945]

---

## Challenges of Algorithmic Moderation: Three Core Problems

1. **Non-Transparency**:
   - Systems are opaque, hard to audit, and shielded by trade secrets
   - Users often don't know why their content was flagged or removed

2. **Fairness and Justice**:
   - AI models can reinforce biases, disproportionately harming certain groups
   - Automated systems often fail to understand context (e.g., reclaiming slurs)

3. **Depoliticisation**:
   - Platforms present AI moderation as "neutral," hiding the political decisions behind what speech is allowed
   - Risk: automated systems make speech governance invisible and harder to contest

> "Well-optimized moderation systems could exacerbate, rather than relieve, many existing problems."

# The Facebook Oversight Board


---

## The Oversight Board

> "A kind of global 'supreme court' for speech."

- Established 2020 by Facebook
- *Independent* review of controversial content moderation cases
- Binding decisions (case-by-case)
- Introduces transparency and consistency
- Criticism: Limited to takedown decisions, ignores algorithmic amplification

.content-box-green[
### High-Profile Cases

- Upheld Trump’s two-year suspension
- Demanded clearer rules and standards from Facebook
