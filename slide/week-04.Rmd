## Introduction
- Political communication occurs within **public spheres**, where citizens engage in discussions, debates, and political actions.
- **Digital platforms** have transformed the public sphere by altering:
  - How opinions are formed.
  - The reach of political messaging.
  - The nature of political mobilization.
- While public spheres **enable democracy**, they are often sites of **conflict and contestation**.

> “A democratic system is damaged as a whole if the infrastructure of the public sphere cannot direct the .content-box-yeallo[attention] of citizens to the relevant issues that need to be decided, and can no longer guarantee the formation of competing public opinions, i.e., qualitatively filtered opinions.” (Habermas, 2021)

# The Public Sphere

---

## The Importance of Public Spheres
- The concept of **public spheres** has been central to political communication theory for decades.
- Public spheres serve key functions:
  - **Opinion formation** – citizens express and shape collective viewpoints.
  - **Public accountability** – political actors are scrutinised.
  - **Democratic participation** – civic engagement and mobilization.
- Digital platforms **both enhance and challenge** these functions.

.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Kahvihuone.jpg', width = '35%'>]

---

## Digital Platforms and Public Spheres
- Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube serve as **primary public arenas** in the digital age.
- They differ from traditional public spheres in that they are:
  - **Algorithmically curated** – what users see is determined by machine learning models.
  - **Privately owned** – platforms are **corporate-controlled**, not state-regulated (except in some countries).
  - **Monetised through engagement** – content that generates clicks is prioritized.
- **Platforms are not neutral** – their design and business models shape public discourse.

---

## The Structure of Public Spheres
- Public spheres exist **between** different forces:
  - **The state** – Government institutions influence public discourse through policy and official messaging.
  - **The market** – Commercial interests shape public discussions via media ownership and advertising.
  - **The private sphere** – Personal interactions and relationships affect public dialogue.
- **Platforms blur these distinctions**:
  - State actors use them for governance and propaganda.
  - Commercial entities manipulate public opinion for profit.
  - Private discussions frequently become political.

---

## Public Spheres in the Digital Era
- Historically, public spheres were tied to **physical spaces** (coffeehouses, town halls, newspapers).

.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/ParisCafeDiscussion.png' width = '20%'>]

- Today, they exist in **networked, digital environments**.
- This shift has led to:
  - **Greater participation** – anyone can contribute.
  - **Global interconnectivity** – national borders are less relevant.
  - **Faster information spread** – issues emerge and escalate rapidly.

# Counterpublics

---

## What are Counterpublics?  

- **Counterpublics** are alternative public spheres where marginalised groups create their own spaces for discourse, identity formation, and resistance against dominant narratives.  
- They emerge when **mainstream public spheres exclude or misrepresent** certain social groups.  
- **Key characteristics** (Fraser, 1990):  
  - **Parallel discursive arenas** – Spaces where subordinated groups develop their own interpretations and critiques of power.  
  - **Resistance and mobilisation** – Serve as bases for organising political action and challenging dominant ideologies.  
  - **Cultural and political identity formation** – Help marginalised communities articulate their shared experiences.

## Counterpublics: Examples



.pull-left[

.small[

#### **Feminist Counterpublics**  
Created feminist media, publications, and advocacy groups. Introduced concepts like **sexual harassment, marital rape** into public discourse.  

#### **Black Civil Rights Counterpublics**  
Black churches, newspapers, and organisations contested racial segregation. Leaders like **MLK and Malcolm X** mobilised through alternative spaces.  

#### **Labour Movement Counterpublics**  
Unions and socialist groups fought for **workers’ rights, fair wages, and conditions**. Organised strikes and protests as a counter to corporate power.  

]

]


.pull-right[

.small[

#### **LGBTQ+ Counterpublics**  
Community publications, pride events, and advocacy groups. Movements like **ACT UP** resisted public silence on the HIV/AIDS crisis.  

#### **Anti-Colonial & Indigenous Counterpublics**  
Indigenous activism through storytelling, land defence, and digital platforms. Movements like the **Zapatistas** challenge colonial oppression.

## The Emergence of Digital Counterpublics
- **Counterpublics** are groups that challenge dominant narratives within public spheres.
- **Examples of digital counterpublics**:
  - **Black Twitter** – A digital space where Black users challenge racism, police brutality, and mainstream media narratives.
  - **#MeToo Movement** – A social media-driven campaign against sexual harassment and assault.
  - **Climate Activism (e.g., Fridays for Future)** – Youth-led movements using platforms to mobilize global protests.
- Counterpublics provide spaces for marginalised voices to develop alternative discourses and challenge dominant power structures.

---

## Understanding Black Twitter  
- **Black Twitter** is an online space where African Americans engage in discourse on racial justice, politics, and culture.  
- It has played a major role in **national conversations** on racial inequality and police violence.  
- **Key functions**:
  - **Cultural expression** – Sharing experiences, humor, and commentary on Black life.  
  - **Political mobilization** – Organizing protests and activism (#BlackLivesMatter, #ICantBreathe).  
  - **Media critique** – Holding journalists and politicians accountable.  

> “Black Twitter possesses more of the characteristics of a counterpublic compared to other hashtag-based publics.” (Graham & Smith, 2016)

.footnote[Graham, R., & Smith, ‘Shawn. (2016). The Content of Our #Characters: Black Twitter as Counterpublic. *Sociology of Race and Ethnicity*, 2(4), 433–449. https://doi.org/10.1177/2332649216639067]

---

## Black Twitter as a Digital Counterpublic  
- **Counterpublics** challenge dominant narratives and provide alternative spaces for marginalized voices (Fraser, 1990).  
- **Findings from the study**:
  - **More interactive than mainstream political hashtags** – Black Twitter users reply and discuss more than they simply retweet.  
  - **Distinct thematic content** – Unlike mainstream political spheres, Black Twitter focuses on issues of racial justice.  
  - **Challenges mainstream discourse** – Critiques media framing of Black issues and amplifies alternative perspectives.  
- **Example**: The viral nature of hashtags like **#BlackLivesMatter** has influenced mainstream political debates.  
- **Key takeaway**: Black Twitter serves as a **parallel discourse space**, shaping public opinion while resisting dominant narratives.

# The Consequences of Platforms for Public Spheres

---

## How Platforms Shape Public Spheres
- Platforms influence discourse through:
  - **Algorithmic amplification** – Some voices are prioritised over others.
  - **Personalisation** – Users see information tailored to their past behaviour.
  - **Content moderation** – Platforms enforce rules that shape what is allowed.
- **Key challenge**: Platforms balance free expression with preventing harmful content.

---

## Affective Publics and the Role of Emotion
- Political communication on platforms is often **emotionally charged**.
- **Affective publics**: Groups mobilized around shared emotions, such as outrage or solidarity.
- **Examples**:
  - Viral political hashtags (#BlackLivesMatter, #StopTheSteal).
  - Protest movements that gain traction through emotional narratives.

> “The intensity of emotion can disrupt dominant political storytelling and narratives.”

---

## The Rise of Polarisation: Filter Bubbles and Echo Chambers
- **Filter bubbles**: Users are algorithmically exposed to content that aligns with their views.
- **Echo chambers**: Users actively seek out like-minded communities, reinforcing their beliefs.
- **Platforms often amplify divisive content** to increase engagement.

.pull-left[
- **Reality check**:
  - Not all users are trapped in bubbles.
  - Some are exposed to opposing views through *incidental exposure*.

## Also, fragmentation is not always bad...

.small[

**Traditional view**: Deliberative democracy seeks **consensus** and sees **fragmentation** as harmful to the public sphere. But this view **ignores power asymmetries** and assumes rational, neutral deliberation is possible. A public sphere based on **discursive contestation**, where **fragmentation can enhance democracy**.  

### Why Fragmentation is Not Always Bad for Democracy  
✔ **Empowers marginalised groups** – Enables **counterpublics** to develop their own discourse (e.g., feminist, civil rights movements).  
✔ **Challenges dominant narratives** – Multiple discursive spaces **contest power structures**, fostering pluralism.  
✔ **Encourages diverse perspectives** – Instead of forcing artificial consensus, fragmentation **allows for difference** to be respected.  
✔ **Prevents status quo dominance** – The “middle ground” is often a product of **existing power hierarchies**.  

> "Consensus ... is always intertwined with asymmetrical power relations and a struggle for domination." (Dahlberg, 2007)

---

## Disinformation and Manipulation in Public Spheres
- Platforms are used for **propaganda, misinformation, and manipulation**.
- **Key issues**:
  - **Fake news** spreads faster than factual information.
  - **State-sponsored disinformation** campaigns influence elections.
  - **Conspiratorial movements** (e.g., QAnon) exploit digital public spheres.
- **Platforms struggle to moderate harmful content effectively**.

---

## Case Study: Algorithmic Influence on Political Discourse
- **Facebook’s internal study** found that its algorithms led users towards **far-right extremist content** (Horwitz & Seetharaman 2020).
- **Twitter’s algorithm** amplifies content from right-wing political actors more than left-wing ones (Belli 2021).
- **YouTube’s recommendation system** has been accused of **radicalising viewers** by suggesting extremist content (Tufekci, 2018).

.content-box-yellow[

And yet, robust empirical evidence of this is limited because of non-collaborative attitude of platforms.

]

- **Key question**: Can platforms design algorithms that **prioritize truth over engagement**?

# The Future of Public Spheres

---

## The Future of Public Spheres: Opportunities
- Despite challenges, platforms provide **new possibilities** for public discourse:
  - **Increased political engagement** – More people are informed and active.
  - **Decentralised activism** – Grassroots movements can gain traction without traditional media.
  - **Fact-checking initiatives** – Collaborative efforts counter disinformation.

## The Future of Public Spheres: Challenges
- **Corporate power over digital spaces** – A few companies control most online public discourse.
- **Lack of transparency** – Algorithmic decision-making is largely hidden from users.
- **Regulatory dilemmas** – Governments struggle to balance platform accountability with free speech protections.

---

## The Role of Journalism in Public Spheres
- Platforms have **weakened traditional journalism** but also created **new journalistic forms**:
  - **Digital-native investigative journalism** (e.g., Bellingcat, ProPublica).
  - **Fact-checking collaborations** to combat misinformation.
  - **Citizen journalism** – ordinary people document political events in real time.

## Regulatory Responses to Platform Power
- **Different countries approach platform regulation in different ways**:
  - **EU’s Digital Services Act** – Forces platforms to moderate harmful content more aggressively.
  - **Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code** – Requires platforms to pay news organizations for content.
  - **China’s strict internet regulations** – Government controls digital discourse directly.
- **Open question**: How should democracies regulate platforms while preserving free speech?

---

## Conclusion: The Future of Public Spheres
- Platforms **reshape** rather than replace public spheres.
- **Key questions for the future**:
  - Can platforms be **better regulated** to protect democratic discourse?
  - Will **alternative platforms** emerge to challenge existing tech giants?
  - How can citizens become **more media-literate** in navigating digital public spheres?

> “While platforms are very good at monetizing social relations, they are not particularly good at nurturing public spheres.”
