# Introduction

---

## Campaigning in a Platform Age

> "Political communication during these campaign periods is decisively different from 'normal,' non-electoral times."

.center[<img src = 'https://www.sydney.edu.au/content/dam/corporate/images/news-and-opinion/paid-images/march2025/aap-one-time-use-only-subscription.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.2000.1333.2x.jpeg' width = '35%'>]

- Campaign periods are key moments of political communication.
- Elections are now data-driven and highly personalised.
- Platforms are central to these transformations.

---

## Campaigning and Democratic Legitimacy

- Campaigns must produce *legitimate results* through fair procedures.
- Even humorous contests (like NZ’s “Bird of the Year”) show how emotional and affective campaigning can be.

> “Campaigning is often affective and emotional.”

## Threats to Electoral Integrity

.pull-left[

- **Delegitimising elections**
  - Political leaders and media actors may claim elections are "rigged" or unfair without evidence.
  - These narratives can erode public trust in electoral outcomes and weaken democratic norms.
  - *“Strategic claims that elections are not free and fair... democracy is in danger.”* 



]

.pull-right[

- **Expanding executive power**

  - Leaders in hybrid or authoritarian regimes often exploit legal mechanisms to centralise power.
  - Examples include Erdogan in Turkey and Orbán in Hungary.
  - These expansions may be legal, but they undermine checks and balances.

- **Harassing opposition**
  - Use of state resources, media manipulation, and legal persecution to silence or intimidate political opponents.
  - Can include disinformation campaigns or delegitimisation of dissenting voices.


]


---

### The role of belief and legitimacy:

> “The stability of a democratic regime rests, in large part, on the belief of its leaders and citizens that democracy is the best (or the least evil) political system.”

- **Elite commitment** is essential: political parties must be willing to lose elections and accept the results.

- **Citizen belief** in the electoral process and in future political competition is foundational.
- When adversaries become enemies and elections are framed as existential battles, democratic legitimacy weakens.

# The Four Ages of Campaigning

---

## Ideal Types of Campaigning

> “Each era is shaped by its own predominant contexts and technologies.”

- The four ages are ideal types, not mutually exclusive.

- Campaigns often mix elements from multiple eras.

---

## 1. Party-Centred Campaigning

- Dominant in the 19th–mid 20th century.
- Strong party apparatuses coordinated campaign messages.
- Emphasis on identity and rewards (e.g., jobs for partisans).

.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Election_Day_1815_by_John_Lewis_Krimmel.jpg/960px-Election_Day_1815_by_John_Lewis_Krimmel.jpg' width = "50%">]

---

## 2. Mass Media-Centred Campaigning

- TV-driven era starting mid-20th century.
- Campaigns adapted to media logics: sound bites, visuals.
- Professionals planned messaging based on polling and ratings.

.center[<img src = 'https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/01_00884497.jpg?quality=85&w=1366' width = '30%'>]

> “The longer process of how parties adapted to the logic of mass media is generally called ‘mediatization’.”

---

## Target-Group-Centred Campaigning

> "Broadcasting messages to the mass public increasingly sat alongside what scholars called 'narrowcasting' by the 1990s."

### Key Features

- **Era:** Emerged post-1970s, accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of **cable and satellite television** and the early **Internet**.
- **Shift:** From general public messaging → to segmented, 

.content-box-purple[

Data-informed communication aimed at **specific demographic, ideological, or consumer groups**.

]

- Campaigns began using **direct mail, email newsletters, digital ads**, and early websites to reach selected voters.

---

### Narrowcasting Replaces Broadcasting

> “Political actors increasingly sought to tailor messages to predefined target groups.” 

.content-box-yellow[

.center[Narrowcasting = targeted appeals instead of one-size-fits-all messages.]

]

- Target groups defined by:
  - **Partisanship**
  - **Race, religion, or ethnicity**
  - **Consumer preferences**
  - **Geography**
  - **Affiliations and identities**

---

### Data and Technology-Driven Strategies

- Growth of **data infrastructures** for managing voter information.
- U.S. parties built vast databases to:
  - Identify relevant voter segments.
  - Optimise messaging for each group.
  - Allocate resources strategically.

---

### Fragmentation of Public Attention

- With more media outlets and Internet access, it became harder to capture mass attention.
- Campaigns had to work harder to identify where their audiences were and **how to reach them** effectively.

.center[<img src = '../img/fragmentation-attention.png' width = '35%'>]

---

### Strategic Implications

- Rise of **issue-specific appeals** and identity politics.
- Increased use of **marketing techniques** (e.g. segmentation, audience testing).
- Greater **efficiency**, but also potential for **echo chambers** and **selective exposure**.

---

## 4. Individual-Centred Campaigning

> “Extending this general trend... enabled parties and their candidates to send more personalized messages to voters by mining, compiling, and integrating data...”

### Key Features

- Emerged in the **post-2008** era, particularly visible in the **Obama and Trump campaigns**.
- Campaigns use **big data analytics** and **AI** to target voters at the **individual level**, based on:
  - Social media activity
  - Demographics
  - Purchase history
  - Political behaviour
  - Geographic and network data

---

### Microtargeting and Personalisation

> “Campaigns increasingly moved to scoring individual citizens’ probability of voting particular ways...”

- **Microtargeting**: crafting messages to individuals based on predicted political behaviours.
- Scores determine:
  - Likelihood to vote
  - Persuasiveness of an issue appeal
  - Type of content most likely to resonate
- Personalised ads are deployed across social media and search platforms (e.g. Facebook, Google, YouTube).

---

### A/B Testing and Real-Time Optimisation

> “Campaigns... create many, many different versions of digital advertising... to see what combination of elements perform the best.”

- Multiple versions of messages tested:
  - Images, fonts, colours
  - Phrasing of appeals
  - Call-to-action (e.g. donate, sign up)
- **Real-time feedback** (clicks, shares, conversions) used to continuously refine strategy.

---

### Data Teams at the Centre

- Tech departments are now **core campaign units**, not just IT support.
- Use of **machine learning** and **algorithmic modelling** to predict voter behaviour.
- Large-scale investments in data teams, especially in the U.S., U.K., and Australia.

---

### Citizen Marketing & Social Dissemination

> “Strategically look to disseminate messages through the cultivation of volunteers and supporters as forms of ‘citizen marketing’.”

- Supporters actively participate in campaigns by:
  - Sharing content
  - Creating memes and TikToks
  - Adopting campaign slogans and aesthetics
- **Peer-to-peer sharing** is more persuasive and trusted than campaign-originated messaging.

---

### Strategic Implications

- **Efficiency**: reach persuadable voters with tailored appeals.
- **Risks**:
  - **Echo chambers** and **filter bubbles**
  - **Manipulation** and lack of transparency
  - **Dark participation**: covert disinformation, trolling, harassment (see subversive campaigning)

### Study Overview
- Examines **three types of political polarisation** on Facebook and Twitter in Israel:
  - **Interactional**: tendency to engage only with ideologically similar actors
  - **Positional**: divergence in issue stances between left and right
  - **Affective**: emotional hostility between camps
  
---

### Methodology
- **Cross-platform, longitudinal analysis (2017–2019)**
- Analysed posts and comments from **four Israeli media outlets** across ideological lines
- Combined **computational methods and content analysis**:
  - Used NLP for stance/emotion detection
  - Network analysis for interaction patterns
  
---

### Key Findings
- **Interactional polarisation** strongest on **Twitter**, weaker on Facebook
- **Positional polarisation** high and **increasing over time**
- **Affective polarisation** was **stable but significant**, with **stronger negativity on Facebook**
- Left and right camps behave differently depending on the platform:
  - Right-wing users more **emotionally expressive**
  - Left-wing users more **issue-focused**

.content-box-yellow[

### Implications
- Platforms shape the nature of political discourse and polarisation
- Highlights need to consider **platform-specific dynamics** in political communication studies
- Suggests that digital public spheres are **not uniform**—structure and **affordances** matter

# Campaigns, Platforms, and Outcomes

---


## Do Platforms Decide Elections?

> “Elections are not won or lost on social media.”

- Structural factors (e.g. economy, incumbency) matter more.

- Platforms amplify, coordinate, and fundraise—but they’re not magic bullets.

- Platforms do not brain-wash people, turning progressives into conservatives or gardening-loving old ladies into far-right activists.   

---

## Context is Crucial

- Campaign effects vary by country, platform, regulation, and party system.

- Example: Social media helps outsiders only when parties are fractured.

> “When institutional elites are aligned, outsiders rarely break through.”

---

## Campaigning Beyond the Ballot Box

- Not all elections are national or high-stakes.

- Most elections do not attract significant media (new and old) attention.

- Includes referendums, local and EU elections.

> “Most research... focuses on campaigning in national elections.”

This creates a significant bias in what we think we know about the media and elections.

# Political Advertising in the Platform Era

---


## Political Advertising: A Historical Tool

- Long tradition of paid political ads, especially in the U.S.
- Advertising moved from newspapers → radio → TV → digital.

.pull-left[

## Platform-Powered Political Advertising

- Digital ads allow fine-tuned targeting and retargeting.
- Platforms monetise political communication.

> “Campaigns use advertising to learn more about people.”

]

.pull-right[

## Data-Driven Ad Strategies

- Collect data through clicks and retargeting.
- A/B testing optimises image, font, layout, colour.
- Behavioural and perceptual effects are measured in real time.

# Platform Campaign Strategies

---


## Attention and Interaction

> “Candidates treated websites primarily as one-way... This began to change during the early and mid-2000s.”

- **Interactivity** now central to campaign strategy.
- Platforms offer controlled environments for structured engagement.

## Mobilisation and Demobilisation

- Platforms mobilise volunteers, donations, votes.
- Also used to demobilise opponents via disinformation or discouragement.

---
class: segue-red

# Political Targeting and Regulation

---


## Data and Privacy Matter

- U.S. has weak privacy laws → extensive microtargeting.
- Germany prohibits storage of personal data (e.g. race, religion).

> “Restrictions... make micro-targeting or individual-level scoring impossible.”

.pull-left[

## Global Variation in Campaign Practice

- Legal frameworks shape how campaigns use platforms.
- Federal candidates have more resources for digital infrastructure.

]


.pull-right[

## Platform Incentives

- Facebook and Google dominate ad markets.
- Algorithms reward content that increases engagement—often emotional or extreme.

# Comparative Campaigning and Research Gaps

---


## Local vs National Dynamics

- Social media less influential in local elections.
- Mass media still dominant in places with strong local press.

## Cross-National and Platform Research Gaps

- Most studies focus on U.S., Twitter, Facebook.
- Need more comparative and Global South research.

# Summary and Implications

---


## Campaigning in the Platform Age

- Campaigns have become more personalised, emotional, and data-driven.
- Platforms offer low-cost access, interactivity, and targeting—but context matters.

--

## Key Takeaways

- Platforms shape, but don’t determine, election outcomes.
- Campaigning is now a hybrid of old and new techniques.
- Regulation and political context determine platform effects.
