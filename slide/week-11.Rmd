# But first... 

# A few words about A3 (Critical analysis essay)

---

**Task**: 3,000-word essay critically analysing a key issue covered in the unit.

Specifically,

| #  | Verb     | Object                        |
|----|----------|-------------------------------|
| 1  | Choose   | a **key issue**, then         |
| 2  | Build    | an **argument** by            |
| 3  | Applying | some **theory** of choice, while |
| 4  | Using    | **real-world examples**       |



### What is an **issue**?

.content-box-yellow[
From my dictionary: "An important **topic** or **problem** for debate or discussion". 
- An *issue* can be one of the **concepts** discussed over the semester. 
- But can also be a specific **event** (or series of *events*). 
]

---

### What is an **argument**?

.content-box-yellow[

An argument is your **main idea** and **claim** about the issue.

- **What** is going on about this issue? 
- And **why**? Or **how**?

Your argument must be **convincing** but also **interesting**.  
]

### What is a **theory**?

.content-box-yellow[

- A theory is an **idea** that **explains** something.

  - A (good) theory can be applied by different researchers to different contexts.

  - But your theory is not what you observe! Instead, a theory helps you make sense of what you observe.

- **Concepts** are the building blocks of theories. 

]

---

## In conclusion ...

### 1. Your **issue** sets the boundaries of your essay  
It defines *what* you're talking about.

### 2. Your **theory** (or theoretical framework) explains your **evidence**  
It helps make sense of real-world examples (i.e. your evidence).

### 3. Your **argument** is convincing when theory and evidence work together  
A clear, consistent application of theory helps you explain, interpret, or gain insight into your chosen issue.

## Theory vs Concept: Connective Action Example

- **Connective action** is a **theory**:  
  It explains how digital media enables new, personalized forms of political participation outside traditional institutions.

- **Networks** are a **concept** in that theory:  
  They describe the digital structures through which individuals connect, share content, and coordinate action.
  
  
---

## Connective Action and Networks in Context

- **Connective action** is a **theory** introduced by Bennett and Segerberg  
  - to .content-box-red[**explain**] .content-box-red[**how**] modern protests (like Occupy or the indignados)  
  - .content-box-yellow[are driven by personalized expression shared through digital media].

- **Networks** are a **concept** used in this theory:  
  - They .content-box-red[**describe**] the flexible, opt-in/opt-out digital connections (e.g. Twitter, WhatsApp) 
  - .content-box-yellow[through which people coordinate actions without relying on formal organisations.]
  
  
.content-box-green[

Notably, connective action theory was then .content-box-red[**used**] (because found *useful*) by other researchers to explain .content-box-red[**whys**] and .content-box-red[**hows**] about the emergence of other movements.

]


---

## Do I need to use relevant theories (and their concepts) in my A3?

- **Yes!** Using theory is essential. And it is likely easier for your to build your argument around a single **theory**. 

- Don't list a bunch of theories without applying them! Relying on too many theories can confuse your argument — and your reader.

## Where can I find theories and concepts to use?

- Start with the **index of your textbook** — it’s a great place to find key theories and related concepts we've covered.

## Introduction

### What is Populism?

- Populism spans the left and right (e.g. Bolsonaro, Ocasio-Cortez, Orbán)
- The term is often used pejoratively or strategically to delegitimise
- Populism can stabilise or undermine democracies

### What about platforms?

- Platforms help populists bypass traditional gatekeepers
- Social media foster direct, emotional, and polarising communication

# What Is Populism?

---



.content-box-yellow[

## Mudde's definition of Populism

- Populism is a **“thin” ideology** because it has only a small set of core ideas and must attach itself to other, more developed ideologies—like nationalism or socialism—to offer a full political programme. (Mudde, 2004)
- Core idea: **virtuous people** vs. **corrupt elites**
- **Populist logic**:
  1. Homogeneous “people” with shared morality
  2. Threatened by elites and often by out-groups
  3. Leadership claims to represent the true will of the people
- Populism adapts to context (left/right, democratic/authoritarian)
- Debate: populism as a threat or a corrective to democracy

]

.footnote[Mudde, C. (2004) “The populist zeitgeist,” *Government and Opposition* 39(4): 541–63.]

---

## Populism as a Corrective to Democracy

- Populism can restore **political voice** to groups who feel excluded  
- Emphasises a **direct connection** between people and leaders  
- Critiques **unaccountable elites** and **technocratic governance**  
- Can reinvigorate **participation** and **public debate**

> “Populism is a shadow cast by democracy itself” (Canovan, 1999) — a response to the unmet promises of democratic rule

Populism reminds institutions that **legitimacy** comes from the **people’s will**.

.footnote[Canovan, M. (1999) “Trust the people! Populism and the two faces of democracy,” *Political Studies* 47(1): 2–16.]

---


## Populism as a Threat to Democracy

- Rejects **pluralism** by claiming to speak for the only “**true people**”  
  - Populism can undermine minority-rights
- Undermines **institutions**: courts, media, independent bodies  
- Frames politics as **moral battle**, not **deliberation** — limiting compromise  
- Encourages **concentration of power** in a single charismatic leader

Populism may erode **norms** and **checks** that sustain **liberal democracy**, replacing it with **majoritarian** or **authoritarian** rule.

.content-box-purple[

Fundamentally, populism denies the **legitimacy of pluralism** within the **polity**—it recognises only the will of the "pure people" as valid. As a result, it is ill-equipped for politics as **compromise**, **negotiation**, or **deliberation**, favouring instead a **moralised struggle** between right and wrong.

# Who Is “a Populist”?

---

## Who Is “a Populist”?

- Scholars use **two main approaches** to identify populism:
  1. **Actor-centred**: focuses on leaders, parties, or movements commonly described as populist, analysing their ideology and strategies.
  2. **Message-centred**: analyses communication to detect populist content—such as people-centrism, anti-elitism, and out-group exclusion.

- Populism is **not new**—it dates back to movements like the **People’s Party** in 1890s U.S. agrarian politics.

- Found across the **political spectrum**:
  - **Right-wing populists**: Donald Trump (USA), Marine Le Pen (France), Jair Bolsonaro (Brazil)
  - **Left-wing populists**: Andrés Manuel López Obrador (Mexico), Nicolás Maduro (Venezuela)

- Populism often **emerges outside traditional parties**:
  - e.g. **Five Star Movement** in Italy as a digital grassroots party
  - or **Trump’s takeover** of the Republican Party, despite elite resistance

# Populism as Communication

---

## Populism as Communication

- A **communication-centred approach** focuses on how populism is expressed rather than *who* expresses it.
- Defined by both:
  - **Content**: recurring *themes* such as appeals to “the people,” opposition to “corrupt elites,” and often the exclusion of “out-groups” like immigrants or minorities.
  - **Style**: uses *emotional*, direct, simple, and often transgressive language—outrageous, blunt, and sometimes vulgar.

- Populist leaders **perform authenticity** by breaking elite norms—speaking plainly, using social media, and acting “like one of us.”

---

## Performing Populism on Stage and Online (Bucy et al., 2020)

- Populism isn’t just about **what is said**, but **how** it’s performed—visually, tonally, and emotionally.  
- Analysing the 2016 Trump–Clinton debate, the study by Bucy et al. found Trump’s **transgressive style**—anger, interruptions, gestures—drove higher Twitter engagement.  
- Populist performance includes **simplification**, **emotionalisation**, and **negativity**, amplified via **nonverbal signals**.  

> “Trump’s belligerent nonverbal messaging came across loud and clear and was likely a factor in his ability to bond supporters to his cause.”

.footnote[Bucy, E. P., Foley, J. M., Lukito, J., Doroshenko, L., Shah, D. V., Pevehouse, J. C., & Wells, C. (2020). Performing populism: Trump’s transgressive debate style and the dynamics of Twitter response. *New Media & Society*, 22(4), 634–658. https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444819893984]

---

- They construct a moral universe with three key rhetorical pillars:
  1. “**The people**” are portrayed as **pure, hardworking, and morally upright**
  2. “**The elites**” are framed as **corrupt, self-serving, and out of touch**
  3. “**Out-groups**” are seen as **dangerous threats** to the people’s unity and values

> “like a ‘drunken guest’ … with ‘bad manners’ …, the populist disrupts the normal dinner table, much to the discomfort, even alarm, of the usual patrons” Oliver & Rahn (2016)

- According to de Vreese et al. (2018), a **full populist message** requires the presence of all three: people-centrism, anti-elitism, and out-group exclusion.

.footnote[Oliver, J. E. & Rahn, W. M. (2016) “Rise of the Trumpenvolk: populism in the 2016 election,” *The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science* 667(1): 189–206. De Vreese, C. H., Esser, F., Aalberg, T., Reinemann, C., & Stanyer, J. (2018) “Populism as an expression of political communication content and style: a new perspective,” *The International Journal of Press/Politics* 23(4): 423–38.]

---

## Fourfold typology of messages (de Vreese et al., 2018)

- **Full populism**: combines all three core elements—**people-centrism**, **anti-elitism**, and **exclusion of out-groups**.  
  - Example: Far-right populists who attack political elites and scapegoat migrants.

- **Anti-elitist populism**: pits “the people” against “the corrupt elite,” but does **not target out-groups**.  
  - Example: Some left-wing populists like Podemos focus mainly on economic elites.

- **Exclusionary populism**: defines “the people” in opposition to **out-groups**, but without criticising political elites.  
  - Example: Politicians who present national identity as under threat from outsiders (e.g. anti-immigration rhetoric) without attacking the political system.

- **Empty populism**: refers broadly to “the people” without identifying specific enemies.  
  - Often used as a vague rhetorical device in mainstream politics.

- This typology allows researchers to **empirically detect populist discourse**, even where actors reject the populist label.

.footnote[De Vreese, C. H., Esser, F., Aalberg, T., Reinemann, C., & Stanyer, J. (2018) “Populism as an expression of political communication content and style: a new perspective,” *The International Journal of Press/Politics* 23(4): 423–38.]

# Are Platforms Driving Populism?

---

## Are Platforms Driving Populism?

- Digital platforms reshape political communication by **removing traditional gatekeepers** like journalists and editors.
- Populist actors use these tools to **speak directly to followers**, presenting themselves as authentic and unfiltered.

> “Social media help to nurture the illusion of closeness” between leaders and the people.

- Populists benefit from key platform dynamics:
  - **Bypassing journalistic scrutiny**, avoiding fact-checking or debate
  - **Amplification of affective content**, especially anger and fear
  - **Micro-targeting** audiences based on emotions and interests
  - Use of **metrics like likes, shares, and comments** to gauge support
  
---

- Algorithmic incentives favour:
  - **Simplicity** over nuance
  - **Outrage** over civility
  - **Fear and anger** over reasoned argument

- As the chapter puts it:  
  > “Populist communication provides the perfect content for platforms—constant provocations, angry memes, and clickbait.”

- Populist style—emotional, moralistic, binary—is **ideally suited** to fast, visual, mobile-first environments.


---

## Platform Affordances

- **Affordances** are

> **relational property that describes the possibilities for action provided by an environment or technological system**. Bucher and Helmond (2018)

- Key platform affordances that benefit populist actors:

.content-box-purple[

1. **Direct engagement** with followers without intermediaries (e.g. Trump on Twitter now on Truth)

]

---

.content-box-purple[

2\. Construction of **authenticity and intimacy**—appearing ‘real’ and relatable

3\. Marginalisation of **expert knowledge and journalistic filters**

4\. **Speed and virality**, enabling rapid crisis framing and reaction

]

- These affordances allow populists to appear **anti-elite even while in power**, blurring the line between opposition and governance.

- Platforms collapse roles: politicians **govern and campaign simultaneously**, using social media to maintain continuous mobilisation.

- Populists can continue to act like insurgents while sitting in the seat of power.

---

## Out-Group Targeting by Platforms

- Platforms don't just amplify populism—they can **facilitate radicalisation**.

- **Group-based affordances** (e.g. Facebook groups, Telegram channels) create closed spaces for reinforcing identity and hostility.

- Recommendation systems push users toward more extreme content:
  
> “64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendation tools” — internal Facebook report (Hatmaker 2020)

- This process often unfolds gradually:
  - A user clicks on one video or post
  - Is then shown more provocative or divisive content
  - Enters group spaces where **“us vs them” narratives** dominate
  
.footnote[Hatmaker, T. (2020) “Facebook hits pause on algorithmic recommendations for political and social issue groups,” *TechCrunch*, October 30: https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/facebook-group-recommendations-election.]

---

- **Telegram** is a key example—used for sharing memes, calls to action, conspiracy theories, and extremist manifestos with little oversight.

- These environments foster **ideological hardening**:
  - They reward loyalty and hostility
  - They isolate users from dissenting views
  - They present a shared moral universe under siege

- As the chapter notes: “First there is a like, then a comment... The path to radicalisation begins with platform design.”

---

## Are Campaigns Getting Uglier?  (Klinger, Koc-Michalska & Russmann, 2023)

- Across 12 countries, the study finds that Facebook campaigning became **more negative, dramatic, and populist** between 2014 and 2019 EU elections.  

- Posts with **negative emotion and dramatization** gained **more likes, shares, and comments**—rewarded by algorithms and users.  

- Populist content boosted engagement in 2014 but less so by 2019.  

> “Parties exploit platforms’ preference for affective, angry messages to gain visibility—even at the cost of democratic norms.”

.footnote[Klinger, U., Koc-Michalska, K., & Russmann, U. (2023). Are Campaigns Getting Uglier, and Who Is to Blame? Negativity, Dramatization and Populism on Facebook in the 2014 and 2019 EP Election Campaigns. *Political Communication*, 40(3), 263–282. https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2022.2133198]

# Radicalism and Extremism

---

## Radicalism vs Extremism: Distinguishing Terms

- While often conflated in public discourse, **populism**, **radicalism**, and **extremism** are analytically distinct.

- **Radicalism**:
  - Seeks **fundamental change** to the political, economic, or social system
  - Operates **within democratic norms**
  - Can enhance democracy by broadening representation and challenging unjust structures
  - Found on both left (e.g. democratic socialism) and right (e.g. market libertarianism)

- **Extremism**:
  - **Rejects democracy**, pluralism, and civil liberties
  - Often supports **violence** or authoritarian solutions
  - Aims to **overthrow or subvert** democratic institutions
  - Frequently associated with supremacist, nationalist, or millenarian ideologies

---

> “The radical right is often uncompromising... The extreme right seeks to overthrow democracy”.

- Mislabeling **extremists** as **populists** can:
  - **Normalise** anti-democratic rhetoric
  - **Obscure real threats** to democratic stability
  - Undermine legitimate forms of dissent and democratic challenge

- It is essential to **preserve analytical clarity** to avoid conflating legitimate political contestation with violence and authoritarianism.

---

## Extremism and Platform Dynamics

- **Extremist actors** strategically exploit digital platforms to spread hate, recruit followers, and coordinate actions.

- They often rely on **fringe or encrypted platforms**:

  - **Telegram** enables rapid dissemination of memes, propaganda, and mobilisation without moderation (it is now head-quartered in Dubai, UAE).
  
  - Sites like **8kun** (formerly 8chan) host extremist content shielded from regulation and public scrutiny.

- Some use platforms for **spectacle and terror**:
  - The Christchurch shooter **livestreamed** his mass killing in 2019 on Facebook (with link posted on 8chan), turning violence into a global performance.

- **Vulnerable populations** are particularly at risk:
  - **Youth**, who are digitally immersed and often seeking identity or belonging
  - **Minority communities**, who face targeted disinformation and hate speech

---

> “51% of all adolescents reported to be at least occasionally exposed to extremist content via social networking sites” (Schmuck et al. 2022).

- Platforms offer **visibility and reach** to actors once confined to margins:
  - They create **networks of grievance and mobilisation**
  - They foster **echo chambers** that intensify ideological commitment
  - They allow for **transnational coordination** among hate groups

- The affordances that enable populism—**virality, anonymity, direct reach**—also empower extremism when left unchecked.

.footnote[Schmuck, D., Fawzi, N., Reinemann, C., & Riesmeyer, C. (2022) “Social media use and political cynicism among German youth: the role of information-orientation, exposure to extremist content, and online media literacy,” *Journal of Children and Media* 16(3): 313–31.]

# Summary

---

## Summary

- **Populism**, **radicalism**, and **extremism** are not interchangeable
- Populism is common in democracies and may be **inclusionary**
- Radical actors seek reform; extremists seek destruction of democracy
- Platforms *afford*:
  - **Amplification** of emotional and divisive content
  - **Direct** leader-follower relationships
  - **Evasion** of journalistic and institutional checks
- Distinguishing these categories is essential for democratic analysis
