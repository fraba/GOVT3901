# Introduction

---

## Digital Movements in a Global Age
- “Platforms have decisively changed the notion of what it means to be part of a movement.”
- `#EndSARS` as a global example of hashtag-based solidarity: from Nigeria to Washington, Mumbai, and Santiago.
- Platforms globalise struggles, spotlight injustice, and activate affective publics.

## What is a Movement?
- “All you need is people.”
- Movements = shared identity, drive, belief, action.
- Can fight *for* or *against* change.

---

## Contemporary Importance of Movements
- In an era of: climate change, racism, sexism, pandemics, mental health crises, and more.
- “Movements have helped us understand them as problems to be addressed through politics.”

## Variety and Form
- **Political ends** (e.g. campaign finance) vs. **lifestyle changes** (e.g. environmental sustainability).
- **Violent** or **non-violent**; formal organisations or spontaneous protests.
- Example: “quiet encroachment” in authoritarian regimes (Bayat 2013).

> “The urban poor made sure to secure shelter, consolidate their communities, and earn a living by devising work in the vast subsistent and street economy [...] youths took every opportunity to affirm their autonomy, challenge social control and plan for their future…” (Bayat, 2013, p. 589).

# Defining Social Movements

---

## What Are Social Movements?

- Social movements pre-date the term itself.
- Lorenz von Stein’s *History of the French Social Movement* (1848) is among the earliest uses of the term.
- Classic example: the American Revolution (Tilly 2004).

.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/La_Libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple_-_Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_Mus%C3%A9e_du_Louvre_Peintures_RF_129_-_apr%C3%A8s_restauration_2024.jpg/600px-La_Libert%C3%A9_guidant_le_peuple_-_Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix_-_Mus%C3%A9e_du_Louvre_Peintures_RF_129_-_apr%C3%A8s_restauration_2024.jpg' width = '40%'>]

.footnote[Tilly, C. (2004). *Social movements, 1768–2004*. Paradigm Publishers.]

---

## Social Movements: Definitions and Key Elements

> “Networks of informal interactions between a plurality of individuals, groups and/or organizations, engaged in political or cultural conflicts, on the basis of shared collective identities.” – *Diani (1992)*

**Key characteristics:**
- **Networks**: Movements consist of loosely connected individuals and organisations.
- **Informality**: Not all movements are formally structured.
- **Conflict-driven**: Political or cultural conflict is central.
- **Collective identity**: Shared sense of purpose binds actors.

.footnote[Diani, M. (1992). The concept of social movement. *The Sociological Review, 40*(1), 1–25. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-954X.1992.tb02943.x]

---

## What Do Movements Do?

- Form alliances between different actors (e.g. environmental and labour groups).
- Develop shared beliefs that:
  - Critique the status quo
  - Propose solutions
  - Justify political action (Gillan 2008): Moral framing, Legitimacy claims, Narratives and urgency of harm, etc.

.footnote[Gillan, K. (2008). Understanding meaning in movements: A hermeneutic approach to frames and ideologies. *Social Movement Studies, 7*(3), 247–263.]

### A working defintion of social movements

> "Social movements are **networks of actors** organised around **convergent identities and interests** pursuing change — or resisting change — in response to perceived deficiencies in the status quo."

---

## Movements and Democracy

- Movements can both **strengthen** and **destabilise** democratic systems.
- Example: Right-wing nativist movements opposing demographic change.
- Counter-example: Movements for greater democratic inclusion and equality.
- Backlash is common (e.g. white backlash to Black Lives Matter in the US).

---

## Movements in Global Perspective

- Movements are active globally — in democracies and authoritarian states alike.
- **Examples:**
  - Activists in Burkina Faso and Belarus challenge political elites.
  - COVID-19 catalysed digital activism across Southeast Asia (Corpuz 2021).

## The Risks and Costs of Movements

- **Repression**: Threat of jail, violence, or death (especially in authoritarian states).
- **Endurance**: Many activists don’t live to see the change they seek.
  - *e.g. Martin Luther King Jr.*
  
.footnote[Corpuz, J. C. (2021). COVID-19 and the rise of social activism in Southeast Asia: A public health concern. *Journal of Public Health, 43*(2), 344–365.]

---

## Movements as Agents of Change

- Movements can shape:
  - **Policy**
  - **Public discourse**
  - **National identity**
  - **Political systems**

- Their influence is amplified when supported by:
  - Strong leadership
  - Media visibility
  - Political allies
  - Organisational networks

# Theories of Social Movements

---

## 1. Resource Mobilisation Theory (RMT)
- Movements need money, people, time, skills (McCarthy & Zald 1977).
- “Without sufficient funding, it is almost impossible to fight dictatorships.”

## Spotlight: Open Society Foundation
- Open Society Foundation (OSF) provides civil society funding – often targeted by conspiracy theories.

.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Soros_talk_in_Malaysia.jpg' width = '25%'>]

.footnote[McCarthy, J. D., & Zald, M. N. (1977). Resource mobilization and social movements: A partial theory. *American Journal of Sociology, 82*(6), 1212–1241.]

---

## 2. New Social Movement Theory
- Shift from **class** to **identity**: gender, race, sexuality, culture.
- **Identity as democratic struggle**: for equality, equity, recognition.
- Example: **Feminism** = political and cultural transformation.

.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Emmeline_Pankhurst_addresses_crowd.jpg' width = '45%'>]

.footnote[[Emmeline Pankhurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst) addresses a crowd in New York City in 1913 (Source: Wikipedia)]

---

## 3. Deprivation Theory
- Movements arise from **perceived** or **real** deprivation.
- Absolute vs. relative deprivation (Sen & Avci 2016).
- Example: **Saudi women's right to drive**Covid protests – gains and silences.

.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/WOMEN2DRIVE_logo.png/500px-WOMEN2DRIVE_logo.png' width = '35%'>]

.footnote[Sen, A., & Avci, O. (2016). Why social movements occur: Theories of social movements. *Journal of Knowledge Economy and Knowledge Management, 11*(1), 125–130.]

---

## 4. Political Process Theory
- Success shaped by political opportunity structures.
- Unified elites = movement failure; elite division = opportunities.
- Example: **Covid protests**, civil rights, anti-migration protests.

.center[<img src = 'https://images.theconversation.com/files/328993/original/file-20200420-152571-t5og1a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=30&auto=format&w=600&h=400&fit=crop&dpr=2' width = '45%'>]

# Movements in Platform Contexts

---

## From Organisation (Collective Action) to Connective Action

- Pre-digital movements needed resources, offices, permits, infrastructure.
- Classic problem: “free riding” (Olson 1965).

## Connective Action (Bennett & Segerberg 2013)

- Decentralised, individualised expression via platforms.
- Hybrid forms: movements with organisational cores using digital tools.

.center[<img src = '../img/net-centralised-dencentralised.png' width = '25%'>]

.footnote[Olson, M. (1965). *The logic of collective action: Public goods and the theory of groups*. Harvard University Press. Bennett, W. L., & Segerberg, A. (2013). *The logic of connective action: Digital media and the personalization of contentious politics*. Cambridge University Press.]

---

## Spotlight: Fridays for Future
- Greta Thunberg’s solo protest → global youth movement.
- “Decentralised structure supported through social media platforms.”

.content-box-yellow[

BUT **far-right movements** also excel at decentralised digital organising.

## Connective Action on the Right

# Platforms & Movement Communication

---

## Networked Mobilisation
- No central-to-periphery structure.
- “Peripheral networks” matter – celebrities, influencers, and issue reframing.

## Superspreaders & Hyperactive Users
- Small % create bulk of content (e.g. 0.27% of users → 21% of tweets).
- “Superuser-supremacy” (Hindman et al. 2022).

In the next slide a .content-box-red[**mutual retweet networks**]  

> "In Period 1, far-right accounts are disconnected from the rest of the network and segregated in a peripheral community with no bridge to the rest of the network. In Period 2, the far-right is instead connected to the rest of the network, even if from a peripheral position". (Bailo et al. 2024)

.footnote[Hindman, M., Lubin, N., & Davis, T. (2022, February 10). Facebook has a superuser-supremacy problem. *The Atlantic*. https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/02/facebook-hate-speech-misinformation-superusers/621617.

---

## Strategic Amplification
- Loud minorities can seem like mass movements.
- Example: Anti-vax protests in Germany had outsized policy influence.

## Cross-Platform Dynamics
- Movements migrate content across YouTube, Telegram, WhatsApp, legacy media.
- Under-researched due to data access limits (platforms have been cutting access to researchers.).

---

## Intermediary Networks and Movement–Party Coordination

### From Extremist Fringe to Parliamentary Campaign

- Klinger et al. (2023) show how a far-right campaign ("**Stop the Migration Pact**") spread from the **Identitarian Movement** to the **Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)** via *network handoffs*.
- **Party leaders avoided direct association** with extremist sources while **adopting their framings**.
- **“Intermediary networks”** (low-level party activists, far-right media, superspreaders) played a laundering role:
  - Distanced the campaign from its origins,
  - Enabled uptake by high-level AfD actors.

> “Those network bridges became **source-laundering** mechanisms that obscured demonstrable collaboration [...] and charged it with political legitimacy.”

.footnote[Klinger, U., Lance Bennett, W., Knüpfer, C. B., Martini, F., & Zhang, X. (2023). From the fringes into mainstream politics: Intermediary networks and movement-party coordination of a global anti-immigration campaign in Germany. *Information, Communication & Society*, 26(9), 1890–1907. https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2022.2050415]

---

## The Role of Digital Infrastructure and Superspreaders

- **Superspreaders**: 0.27% of users accounted for 21% of interactions.
- Far-right media (e.g., PI-News, Politikstube) acted as **amplifiers** and early adopters.
- The Identitarian campaign was mirrored by the AfD – even the website URL was copied (`.info` → `.de`).
- Media coverage escalated **after** party uptake, not before.
- **Platform dynamics** allowed:
  - Message laundering,
  - Agenda setting,
  - Strategic ambiguity between party and movement.

> “AfD managed to move radical ideas from the political fringes into the general debate, parliamentary debates and public discourse.”

# State Responses to Movements

---

## Suppression Tactics
- Legal: surveillance, disinformation, arrests.
- Extra-legal: violence, infiltration, character assassination.

## Digital Authoritarianism
- Internet shutdowns (e.g. Sri Lanka 2022), facial recognition, cyber ministries.
- Social media access restricted after Turkey detained Istanbul Mayor and opposition leader Imamoglu in March 2025.
- Mugabe (Zimbabwe) in 2017 first “Cyber Security” minister globally.

---

## Targeting Infrastructure
- Arab Spring response: shutdowns, surveillance, asset seizure.
- Infiltration sows distrust and burnout in movements.

> “Digital technology can make it even more difficult for activists to remain anonymous… IP addresses, real-name policies, and facial recognition compromise personal data.”

# Movements and Journalism

---

## A Complicated Relationship
- Media are vital but double-edged: visibility vs. sensationalism.
- Movements rely on media, but are often delegitimised or trivialised.

## Framing & Bias
- Press favours drama, not depth (Sobieraj 2011).

- Right vs. Left bias in coverage (Mourão & Chen 2020; Gruber 2023).

.footnote[Sobieraj, S. (2011). *Soundbitten: The perils of media-centered political activism*. New York University Press. Mourão, R. R., & Chen, W. (2020). Covering protests on Twitter: The influences on journalists’ social media portrayals of left- and right-leaning demonstrations in Brazil. *The International Journal of Press/Politics, 25*(2), 260–280. https://doi.org/10.1177/1940161219894965.

---

## State Influence Over Journalism
- Tactics: intimidation, censorship, paid propaganda.
- In authoritarian regimes, journalists follow state directives (Moon 2019).

# Summary


---

## Key Takeaways
1. Platforms have reshaped how movements are **organised**, **perceived**, and **repressed**.
2. Movements today are more **visible**, **decentralised**, and **dynamic** – but still vulnerable.
3. Theories like RMT, New Social Movement Theory, and Political Process Theory remain vital tools.
