## Your teacher
	
Francesco Bailo (francesco.bailo@sydney.edu.au)

I am a Lecturer in the School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Sydney. I am interested in researching forms of political engagement and political talk on social media. I researched the emergence and dynamics of online communities, the role between news organisations and social media, and the interdependence between social media activists and news organisations. I have engaged with and applied quantitative research methods developing expertise in quantitative text analysis (NLP) and network analysis.

This year I am teaching GOVT3901, SSPS4102/SSPS6006 and GOVT6139

## Slide 2: Lecture Objectives
### By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:
- Explain the intricate relationship between media, technology, and political communication, tracing historical developments and modern transformations.
- Define key terms such as media, digital media, the Internet, social media, platforms, and technologies, ensuring clarity in conceptual understanding.
- Recognize the importance of analyzing digital platforms within contemporary political communication.

## Slide 3: Angela Merkel’s Reflection on Digital Media
### Angela Merkel’s Farewell Interview (2021):
- Angela Merkel, former Chancellor of Germany, offered a reflection on how political discourse has changed due to digital media.
- She noted that in 2005, when she assumed office, smartphones, Facebook, and Twitter were either non-existent or in their infancy.
- Merkel expressed concerns that digital platforms contribute to a harsher political climate by reinforcing ideological silos and reducing opportunities for constructive debate.
- This highlights a central theme of the book: the evolving landscape of political communication in the platform era.

---

## Slide 4: The Digital Transformation of Political Communication
- Traditional political communication was structured around mass media, such as newspapers, radio, and television.
- The Internet and digital media have revolutionized the way information is disseminated and consumed, making communication more participatory and interactive.
- Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube serve as intermediaries, influencing what information reaches the public and how political actors engage with audiences.
- This shift has raised questions about misinformation, polarization, and the role of algorithms in shaping political discourse.

---

## Slide 5: The Role of Technology in Political Communication
- **Technology has always played a role in shaping political communication.**
- Oral traditions helped societies transmit political narratives before the advent of writing systems.
- The printing press, telegraph, radio, and television each transformed political discourse in distinct ways.
- The rise of the Internet and social media platforms has brought about a decentralized, user-driven form of political communication, changing how politicians, activists, and the public interact.

---

## Slide 6: The Internet and the Platform Era
- The Internet became a major force in global politics in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
- The widespread adoption of smartphones accelerated the shift towards mobile-first digital interactions.
- The Arab Spring demonstrated the potential of social media to mobilize protests and activism, while subsequent events, such as Brexit and the 2016 U.S. elections, highlighted concerns about digital manipulation and disinformation.
- The platform era signifies the dominance of a few large corporations in structuring political conversations, often with opaque algorithms determining visibility and engagement.

---

## Slide 7: The Dual Nature of Platforms
### Positive Impacts:
- Increased political engagement and mobilization through digital activism.
- More access to diverse political viewpoints and alternative media sources.
- Enhanced transparency and direct communication between political leaders and the public.

### Negative Impacts:
- The spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories.
- Algorithm-driven polarization leading to echo chambers and filter bubbles.
- The commodification of political discourse through data-driven advertising and microtargeting.

---

## Slide 8: Platforms and Political Actors
- **Political leaders** use platforms to engage directly with constituents, bypassing traditional media gatekeepers.
- **Journalists** rely on social media for real-time reporting and audience engagement.
- **Civil society organizations** leverage digital platforms for advocacy, petitions, and awareness campaigns.
- **Citizens** use social media to participate in political discussions, share content, and mobilize for causes.
- The interplay between these actors reshapes political communication in fundamental ways.

---

## Slide 9: Platform Power and Media Systems
- Platforms serve as both infrastructure and gatekeepers of political discourse.
- Affordances of platforms, influence what information gains traction.
- Media systems are increasingly hybrid, blending traditional broadcast media with digital-first content distribution.
- Example: Twitter has become a primary space for political scandals and crisis management, forcing traditional media to respond to trending digital conversations.

## What are affordances?

Bucher and Helmond (2018) define affordances as a **relational property that describes the possibilities for action provided by an environment or technological system**. The concept originates from ecological psychology and has been adapted in design studies and media research. In the context of social media platforms, affordances are *not static* features but *dynamic relationships* between *users and the platform*'s technological architecture.

In essence, affordances define .content-box-yellow[what users can do on a platform], but .content-box-yellow[they do not dictate behaviour]—rather, they .content-box-yellow[structure possibilities and constraints within the platform environment].

## Affordances are ...

.blockquote[
### `r icons::fontawesome("wrench")` Affordances
- **Relational Nature**: Affordances exist in the interaction between users and the platform; they are not just built-in features but also shaped by user expectations and behaviors.
- **Perceived vs. Hidden Affordances**: Some affordances are immediately visible and easily understood by users (e.g., a "Like" button), while others may require exploration or experimentation (e.g., algorithmic content curation).
- **Communicative and Social Affordances**: Social media affordances enable different types of communication and social interaction, such as visibility (who sees what), editability (the ability to modify content), persistence (how long content remains available), and association (how users are linked to content and each other).
- **Platform-Sensitive Approach**: Affordances are platform-specific and influenced by changes in platform architecture, such as Twitter replacing the "Favorite" star with a "Like" heart, altering the perceived meaning of user interactions.

## Slide 10: Global Variations in Platform Governance
- The regulatory landscape of digital platforms varies significantly across different regions:
  - **United States:** Emphasis on free speech with limited platform regulation.
  - **European Union:** Stronger data protection and content moderation policies.
  - **China & Russia:** State-controlled platforms with strict content guidelines.
- The notion of a "splinternet" reflects the increasing fragmentation of digital spaces due to national regulations.

## Slide 11: Defining Key Terms
1. **Media** – Encompasses all forms of communication, including traditional and digital formats.
2. **Digital Media** – Media content distributed in digital formats, accessible via the Internet.
3. **Internet** – A global network enabling connectivity and data exchange.
4. **Social Media** – Platforms that facilitate user-generated content and networked communication.
5. **Platforms** – Digital infrastructures that organize and curate information, interactions, and transactions.
6. **Technologies** – Broadly refers to tools, knowledge, and processes that shape communication and society.
