# What Are Platforms?

---

## First let's define a Key Concept behind Platforms: The Nework Effect

- **Definition:** .conten-box-green[A phenomenon where the value or utility a user derives from a good or service increases as the number of users of that good or service grows.]

- **Key Idea:**
  - More users → greater value
  - Creates barriers to leaving or switching platforms ("lock-in effect")

- **Examples:**
  - **Telecommunications:** More telephones → more valuable network.
  - **Social Media:** Greater number of users increases connection possibilities and content availability, enhancing user engagement.
  - **E-Commerce:** Platforms like eBay or Amazon gain attractiveness with increased buyers and sellers.

## Key (business) characteristics of digital platforms

.content-box-green[

Note: When we refer to digital platforms, we should not only think about **social media platforms** (e.g., Facebook, TikTok, etc.) but also about platforms such as Alphabet (aka Google), Apple, Spotify or Uber...

]

1. **User Interaction**: User can communicate and coordinates, find, create and share content, engage in transactions.

2. **Multisided Markets**: There are different user groups (e.g., content creators, content consumers, advertisers)

3. **Network Effects**: The more users the merrier.

4. **Data-Driven** These platforms collect and analyse user data to *personalise experiences*, *improve services*, and *drive engagement*.

## Definition of Platforms

- **Programmable architectures designed to organise interactions between users.**

- **Academic definitions:**

>"A platform is fueled by data, automated and organized through *algorithms* and *interfaces*, formalised through *ownership* relations driven by *business models*, and governed through user agreements." (Van Dijck, Poell & de Waal, 2018, p. 9)

> "A platform may be defined as a standards-based technical-economic system that may simultaneously **distribute interfaces** into that system through their **remote coordination** and **centralizes their integrated control** through that same coordination." (Bratton, 2018, p. 374)

- Key components include data, algorithms, interfaces, business models, and governance through user agreements.

## Core Components

- **Data:** Information about user behaviour, preferences, and interactions
- **Algorithms:** Automated rules guiding content delivery and decision-making
- **Interfaces:** User-facing features influencing engagement and interactions
- **Business Models:** Monetisation strategies through advertising, subscriptions, and data commodification
- **Governance:** Content moderation, policies, and user agreements

### Yet, there is a problem with these definitions...

# What Platforms Mean for Political Communication

---

## How Platforms "Organise Interactions" Politically

- **Facebook:**
  - Does not produce journalism or directly select news.
  - Acts as a conduit for news outlets to reach audiences.
  - Algorithmically personalises newsfeeds based on user engagement to maximise platform use.
  - Evaluates journalistic credibility (e.g., through fact-checking).

- **Google:**
  - Does not create content but indexes billions of webpages.
  - Determines search rankings based on perceived user preferences and link structures.
  - Shapes how users navigate and discover political information online.

- **Implications:**
  - Platforms hold power over public attention, shaping political discourse indirectly through design and algorithms.
  - Profit motives drive engagement, potentially undermining balanced political communication."

---

## Positive Impacts ...

- **Amplifying voices:** Diversity and representation in political conversations
- **Rapid distribution:** Quick dissemination of content
- **Civic mobilisation:** Effective mobilisation and participation of citizens

## Negative Impacts

- **Commercial logic:** Focus on engagement can undermine democratic discourse
- **Misinformation:** Algorithmic prioritisation can amplify false information
- **Polarisation:** Platforms promote divisive, extreme content

# Platforms Are Not Neutral Technologies

---

## Myth of Neutrality

- Platforms reflect specific commercial interests and strategic design decisions
- Algorithms embody creators' biases and goals, not objective criteria

## Consequences of Design Choices

- Algorithmic amplification influences visibility and user engagement
- Content moderation shaped by social, political, and economic pressures

---

## Platforms: Commercial, Not Neutral

- **Commercial Entities:**  
  - Platforms like Facebook and Google are profit-driven and monetise user data.
  - Commercial interests guide their decisions about content and interaction.

- **Ownership and Control:**  
  - Neither political actors nor citizens fully control these digital spaces.
  - Platforms govern interactions through algorithms and design choices.

- **Political Communication Implications:**  
  - Platforms significantly shape how political messages are disseminated globally.
  - Influence on public attention, discourse structure, and information visibility.
  - Their role in politics is evolving and requires ongoing critical analysis.

## Case Study: Bailo et al. (2021) – Facebook & Australian News Media

- **Context:**  
  - January 2018: Facebook changed its algorithm to prioritise personal content over news.

- **Key Findings:**
  - **Overall Decline:** Reduced visibility of news content and decreased audience traffic from Facebook to Australian news websites.
  - **Social News Impact:** Social news outlets (e.g., BuzzFeed, Pedestrian) experienced significant drops in engagement due to reliance on share-driven content.
  - **Public Service Media Resilience:** ABC and SBS maintained or improved performance, benefiting from high public trust and non-commercial orientation.

- **Implications:**  
  - Demonstrates platform power to impact journalism sustainability.
  - Highlights the need for diverse distribution strategies beyond single-platform reliance.

# The Dimensions of Platform Power

---

| Dimension of Power                   | Explanation                                                  |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Market Power**                     | - Dominance in advertising markets<br>- Influence over political communication infrastructure<br>- Economic impacts on journalism and other media industries |
| **2. Distributional and Attention Power** | - Control of information dissemination<br>- Influence on public discourse and attention through algorithms |
| **3. Intermediary Power**               | - Mediation of interactions across politics, economy, and society<br>- Structuring communication between different actors |
| **4. Content Power**                    | - Establish and enforce moderation policies<br>- Influence public debate and permissible speech |
| **5. Economic Power**                   | - Significant influence on market dynamics and competition<br>- Central in debates over regulation and anti-trust policies |
| **6. Technological Power**              | - Use of algorithms for automated decision-making and content visibility<br>- Algorithms embed political and social values and biases |

## You might remember the three forms of communication power from last week...

.center[[Link to slide here](https://fraba.github.io/GOVT3901/slide/week-02.html#15)]

### Would you be able to connect these six dimentions of platform power to the three communication powers of platforms?

# Implications

---

## Implications for Political Communication

- Need to understand platforms as **influential** yet **contested** political spaces

- Critical role of platform design, user practices, and external regulatory influences

### Misalignment of interests and goals

**Profit** goals of for-profit-platforms vs. the **general interests** for a functioning and functional public conversation (or *public sphere*) supportive of

* The formation of **public opinions** 

* **Democratic institutions and processes**
