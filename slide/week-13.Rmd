## Reflecting on Digital Politics: Semester Wrap-Up and Key Concepts

.center[<img src = '../img/week-13-qr-menti.png' width = '25%'> 

or try https://www.menti.com/al2zcfwti6d3]

---

## Week 1: Introduction – Political Communication  
- **Political communication**: all symbolic expressions shaping public life  
- Includes **power, identity, resources, belonging, legitimacy**  
- **Technologies** shape meaning circulation across time  
- **Platforms** introduce tensions: bias reinforcement, discourse fragmentation  
- Angela Merkel: social media challenges **democratic compromise**  
- Book focus: how platforms reshape communication, democracy, and global power  

---

## Week 2: Definitions and Variations  
- **Political communication** includes more than elections: social movements, protests, memes  
- What’s political depends on **communication struggles**  
- Global variation: e.g., US two-party vs. Swiss consensus systems  
- **Private issues** (e.g., domestic violence, LGBTQIA+ rights) become political  
- Platforms can **democratise** or entrench power depending on context  

---

## Week 3: Platforms and Their Power(s)

.small[

- **Platforms** = programmable architectures organising interactions 
- Operate on **affordances, algorithms, monetisation**  
- Power spans **distribution, infrastructure, governance**  
- Platforms shape visibility, attention, and participation  
- Users: politicians, media, movements, individuals  
- Power is **uneven**: platforms set rules but rely on user content  

.content-box-red[

1. **Instrumentarian power** (Zuboff, 2018), or the ability of platforms to observe, interpret, and modify user behavior through data collection and predictive analytics;
2. **Curation power** (Gillespie, 2018), or the ability to filter, rank, and prioritize content through platform algorithms and moderation policies, thereby structuring what users see and engage with; and 
3. **System administration power** (Bratton, 2016), or sovereign control platforms have over their infrastructure, including the ability to permit or deny access, regulate terms of service, and shape the technical standards for participation. 

]

---

## Week 4: Platforms and Public Spheres  
- **Public spheres**: spaces for opinion, debate, accountability (Habermas)  
- Platforms create **affective publics, counterpublics** (e.g., Black Twitter)  
- **Context collapse**: overlapping audiences (Marwick & boyd)  
- Platforms disrupt public/private boundaries, challenge consensus  
- Scholars debate **post-public sphere** due to fragmented attention  

.center[<img src = 'https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/iS4KYYtwb2HSHBdTNb-NiuVTvHE=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/people-variety-in-viennese-coffee-houses-1165124053-88c429cfa3f849c48cab53cf9dca27a2.jpg' width = '40%'>]

---

## Week 5: Platforms and Journalism  
- **Journalism**: gatekeeping, agenda-setting, framing  
- Platforms challenge **business models**, amplify **misinformation**  
- Rise of **citizen journalism**, especially in crisis  
- **Knowledge institutions** (journalism, academia) vital for accountability  
- Journalism remains inherently **political**: informs publics, holds power to account  

.center[<img src = 'https://www.nyfa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Most-Influential-Journalists-Today.jpg' width = '60%'>]

---

## Week 6: Strategic Political Communication  
- **Strategic communication**: lobbying, PR, advocacy, marketing, diplomacy  
- Aims to **persuade, legitimise, shape publics**  
- Platforms amplify speed, reach, **fragmentation**  
- **Public opinion** is constructed, not raw  
- Communication strategies leverage platform affordances for influence  

---

## Week 7: Campaigns and Campaigning  

.pull-left[

- Four ages:  
  - **Party-centred**  
  - **Mass media-centred**  
  - **Target group-centred**  
  - **Individual-centred** (microtargeting)  
- Platforms enable data-driven, personalised outreach  
- Campaigns shift public discourse but can’t overcome structural factors (e.g., economy, incumbency)  
- Social media helps challengers but reinforces inequalities if resources are imbalanced

---

## Week 8: Platforms and Movements  
- **Movements**: networks with shared identity, collective goals  
- **Resource mobilisation** (McCarthy & Zald) critical to success  
- Digital affordances: **hashtag activism, connective action, transnational solidarity**  
- Formal organisations (SMOs) coordinate resources but may clash with grassroots actors  
- Media visibility can legitimise or undermine movements  

.center[<img src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/aenetworks/image/upload/c_fill,ar_2,w_3840,h_1920,g_auto/dpr_auto/f_auto/q_auto:eco/v1/arab-spring-gettyimages-108994884?_a=BAVAZGDX0' width = '60%'>]

---

## Week 9: Platform Governance  
- **Platform governance** = state regulation + self-regulation + civil society oversight  
- Key issues: **content moderation, privacy, misinformation, hate speech**  
- Example: Europe’s **right to be forgotten**  
- Governance is **multidimensional**, crossing laws, norms, enforcement mechanisms  
- Civil society and researchers push for accountability and reform

]
---

## Week 10: Misinformation, Disinformation, Propaganda  
- **Misinformation** (false, unintentional) vs. **disinformation** (false, intentional) vs. **propaganda** (manipulative campaigns)  
- Platforms amplify speed, reach, virality  
- Leads to **polarisation, mistrust, misperception**  
- Solutions: **fact-checking, media literacy, platform accountability**  
- Democracies must balance openness and harm mitigation  

.center[<img src = 'https://www.bard.edu/files/pr/main_news_image.php?id=16592' width = '40%'>]

---

## Week 11: Populism, Radicalism, Extremism  
- **Populism** = people vs. elites, anti-pluralist, emotional  
- Platforms help bypass gatekeepers, amplify grievances  
- **Radicalism** seeks systemic change; **extremism** often uses violence  
- Platform affordances favour populist communication  
- Populism can challenge or erode democracy depending on actors and context  

---

## Week 12: Politics and Entertainment  
- **Politainment**: memes, celebrity activism, satire, fashion  
- Celebrities become politicians; politicians become celebrities  
- Entertainment shapes **political identity, norms, solidarity**  
- Cultural forms (music, streaming) carry political meaning  
- Debate: trivialisation vs. democratisation of political engagement

# A few concluding remarks

## So what, about platforms, power and politics?

## Origins of the Field

- Political communication formalised in the 1960s (ICA, APSA)
- Defined as **communication shaping meaning around political practices** (Schuetz 2009)
- Textbook expands scope: beyond elites and institutions to movements, identity, culture, health

> "Our model centred platforms… because they provide the infrastructure for much modern-day political communication — and social life far beyond the political."


---

## Platforms at the Centre

- Platforms reshape:
  1. Political capacities of organisations
  2. Collective and connective action
  3. Economics and distribution of information
  4. Organisation of social life
  
- Technologies introduced into **pre-existing** political, social, and economic environments

> "The very same platforms that support global movements for racial justice can also support would-be authoritarians."

---

## Contradictory Findings in Research

- Platforms can **reduce misconceptions** (Garrett 2019),  
  increase political awareness (Ahmad et al. 2019),  
  enhance participation (Dimitrova et al. 2014; Matthes et al. 2019)
- But also **amplify disinformation, misinformation, propaganda** (Persily & Tucker 2020),  
  increase polarisation (Iyengar et al. 2019),  
  spread false beliefs (Pennycook et al. 2021)
- Conditioning effects depend on:
  - Human agency and pre-existing goals (Knoll et al. 2020)
  - Uses and gratifications (Katz et al. 1974)
  - Emotional and cognitive processing (Lazarus 1991; Higgins 1996)

> “People and political systems are agents in media, not passive recipients of information.” (Webster 2014)

---

## Democratic Challenges and Possibilities

- Scholars highlight **serious democratic challenges**:
  - Commercialised, politicised digital ecosystems
  - Misinformation, disinformation, propaganda, polarisation  
    (Iyengar et al. 2019; Pennycook et al. 2021)

- But also acknowledge **radical democratic potentials**:
  - Expanded public spheres
  - Inclusion of voices formerly excluded from participation  
    (Gil de Zúñiga & Chen 2019; Jackson et al. 2020; McIlwain 2019)

> “While many point to the democratic challenges resulting from commercial and highly politicised digital ecosystems… there are also radical potentials for democracy that digital media afford.”

## How does Internet technology affect political protest in autocracies?


.pull-left[

.small[


 - Local-level data across ~70 autocratic countries
 
### Major Findings

- Internet reduces **protest occurrence**:
  - Regimes use propaganda, censorship, surveillance, digital governance

- Internet boosts **protest persistence & diffusion**:
  - Once protest starts, activists use digital tools to sustain and spread action

> “Modern communication technology can empower opposition activists — but also strengthen regime control.”

]

---

### Theoretical Contributions

- Identifies **asymmetric control**:
  - Autocracies often control where and how Internet is deployed
  - Digital tools reinforce or substitute for traditional repression (violence, bans)

- Highlights **contextual variation**:
  - Less repressive regimes rely more on digital control
  - More vulnerable once protests erupt
  
  

.content-box-yellow[

Internet expansion reduces protest overall — but makes regimes more vulnerable when unrest begins.

> “Digital communication’s political effects are fundamentally multifaceted and context-dependent.”

## How does Internet technology affect political protest in democracies?

.pull-left[

.small[

- Internet expands mobilisation beyond dense civic networks:
  - Reaches **disengaged and geographically dispersed** citizens
  - Builds decentralised, flexible organisational models
  
- But **legacy media** play a critical legitimising role:
  - News attention boosts collective efficacy and broadens mobilisation reach (Bailo, 2025)

.content-box-yellow[

In both democracies and autocracies, Internet can provide a formidable tool for sustaining a mobilisation. But the Internet can't **bootstrap** a mobilisation into existence.

---

## Democracy at a Crossroads

### Platforms simultaneously **empower and threaten** democracy:
- Support grassroots mobilisation, amplify marginalised voices, broaden public debate
- Enable authoritarian actors, facilitate disinformation, fuel polarisation, erode public trust

### Democratic gains:
- Platforms expand public spheres, bring in voices formerly excluded from participation
- Create radical possibilities for new forms of civic engagement, activism, and representation

### Democratic risks:
- Commercial incentives, algorithmic design, and polarised ecosystems can amplify misinformation, disinformation, and manipulation
- Undermine deliberative processes, intensify political divisions, weaken institutional legitimacy

---

.content-box-yellow[

> "Authoritarian leaders and anti-democratic groups can use the very same platforms that promote expression and debate."

]

### The key challenge:

- Understand how people, institutions, and technologies interact to shape outcomes
- Recognise platforms’ dual nature: neither inherently liberatory nor inherently repressive, but contingent on political, social, and economic contexts


---

## Responsibility and Hope

- To navigate the challenges of the platform era, we must **reaffirm democratic responsibilities**:
  
### 1. Uphold **knowledge-producing institutions**:
- Journalism, academia, and civic organisations play crucial roles in producing reliable information and fostering informed public debate
- Their survival and integrity are essential to counteract misinformation, polarisation, and declining trust

### 2. Strengthen **cross-political trust and engagement**:
- Democracies depend on trust across lines of political difference
  - This means resisting the demonisation of fellow citizens and creating spaces for deliberation, negotiation, and mutual recognition
  
---

### 3. Demand **accountability**:
- Hold platforms and powerful elites responsible for their roles in shaping democratic life
- Push for ethical governance, transparency, and regulatory frameworks that align technological innovation with the public good

> "It will take all of us to reaffirm the importance of knowledge, reject cynicism, and embrace living in multiracial and multi-ethnic societies where everyone has the same political and civil rights."

- The hope:
  - Despite the threats, platforms hold immense democratic potential if we actively shape how they are used, governed, and integrated into our societies
